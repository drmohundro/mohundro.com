# Still left to do?

## MUST
- Move binary content over to S3 (images, zips, etc)
- What will we do with the "David and Cara's" portion? Wordpress maybe?
- See the rest of the aspx links:
  - find-string 'mohundro.com.+?aspx'
  - things like: 'http://www.mohundro.com/blog/default,month,2008-09.aspx'?

## NICE TO HAVE
- Be nice to change internal links over to new format (avoid 301 redirecting at all)

# Gems to consider pulling in...
