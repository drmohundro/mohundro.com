# Still left to do?

## MUST
- Convert old dasBlog posts from "David and Cara" over to new wordpress blog (mohundrofamily.wordpress.com)
- See the rest of the aspx links:
  - find-string 'mohundro.com.+?aspx' || ack mohundro.com --all
  - I'm thinking I'll just remove some of these links...
- point feedburner to /blog/index.xml

## Nice to haves

- Find images that aren't being used by the site and *drop* them

# Gems to consider pulling in...
