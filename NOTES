# Still left to do?

## MUST
- Move binary content over to S3 (images, zips, etc)
- What will we do with the "David and Cara's" portion? Wordpress maybe?
- See the rest of the aspx links:
  - find-string 'mohundro.com.+?aspx'

## NICE TO HAVE
- Be nice to change internal links over to new format (avoid 301 redirecting at all)
