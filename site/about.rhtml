      </header>

      <p>My name is David, but a lot of people call me Mo. It comes from my last name... <strong>Mo</strong>hundro. You get it, right?</p>

      <p>I'm a software developer/artisan/craftsman/engineer living in the Memphis, TN area. I write in C# for a living, but I also write Ruby for fun. I'm a big fan of JavaScript and PowerShell, too. I use Vim for all of my code editing needs. I use Windows, OS X and Linux. I like technology. Use what works for you!</p>

      <p>I'm a Christian and a husband. My wife and I have a baby on the way. We're also adopting! I like video games, movies, books, and music. I also enjoy traveling.</p>
