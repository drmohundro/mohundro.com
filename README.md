# About mohundro.com

This is the archived source code for the toto version of my website, [mohundro.com](http://mohundro.com/).

The original version of my blog used [dasBlog](https://github.com/shanselman/dasblog). In 2010, I converted it over to [toto](https://github.com/cloudhead/toto) and hosted it with [Heroku](http://heroku.com). In 2015, I decided to move to [hosting it with Github Pages](https://github.com/drmohundro/drmohundro.github.io) using Jekyll. All posts have been moved over to that repository, but I'll keep this one around as an example of a blog setup with toto.

To see more details about the conversion from dasBlog to toto, check out my [blog post](http://mohundro.com/blog/2010/12/23/the-new-blog-is-live/).
