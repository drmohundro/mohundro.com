Never heard of PowerShell you say?

I hadn't either, at least until today. That's because it used to be called Monad. Microsoft released the [RC1 of PowerShell today](http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2006/04/25/583344.aspx) and it is pretty sweet. Basically, it offers scripting and CLI access to the .NET Framework. Instead of using cmd.exe, you'll be using PowerShell.exe. I haven't used it much yet, but it is really cool. Just as a quick example, try this out in PowerShell:

```powershell
$var = "This is a sweet"
```

Now, type `$var`. and then hit tab.

OH WOW! Tab completion for System.String from the command line!

Check it out!
