<p>You know about <a href="http://www.ntwind.com/">NTWind</a> even if you don't think you do... NTWind is where you can get such awesome tools as <a href="http://www.ntwind.com/software/winsnap.html">WinSnap</a> and <a href="http://www.ntwind.com/software/taskswitchxp.html">TaskSwitchXP</a>. The site has had a blog link on the side for a while, but it had been&nbsp;"under construction" for a few months... </p> <p>Until now!</p> <p>So go add the <a href="http://www.ntwind.com/rss.xml">NTWind feed</a> to your reader so that you'll always know when&nbsp;there is an&nbsp;update for one of the NTWind tools!</p>
