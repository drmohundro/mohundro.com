You know about [NTWind](http://www.ntwind.com/) even if you don't think you do... NTWind is where you can get such awesome tools as [WinSnap](http://www.ntwind.com/software/winsnap.html) and [TaskSwitchXP](http://www.ntwind.com/software/taskswitchxp.html). The site has had a blog link on the side for a while, but it had been "under construction" for a few months...  
Until now! 
So go add the [NTWind feed](http://www.ntwind.com/rss.xml) to your reader so that you'll always know when there is an update for one of the NTWind tools!
