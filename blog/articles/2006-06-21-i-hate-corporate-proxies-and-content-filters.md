I hate corporate proxies and content filters!<br /><br />First, it starts blocking <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman</a>'s site for "personal" reasons. Apparently, we can't be looking at the "personal" weblog of a technical speaker and great technical resource!<br /><br />Give me a break!<br /><br />Well, now it is blocking <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>!!! For "personal" reasons!<br /><br />I've got plenty of technical related bookmarks stored out there! It is a great resource!<br /><br />Who knows, my blog may be blocked soon for "personal" reasons!<br /><br />Who runs this junk anyway?!?<br /><br />(I realize that there are completely legitimate reasons for proxies and content filters, but blocking sites for blanket personal reasons is a little ridiculous.)<br />
