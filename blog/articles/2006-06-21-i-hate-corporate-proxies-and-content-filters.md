I hate corporate proxies and content filters!

First, it starts blocking [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/)'s site for "personal" reasons. Apparently, we can't be looking at the "personal" weblog of a technical speaker and great technical resource!

Give me a break!

Well, now it is blocking [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us)!!! For "personal" reasons!

I've got plenty of technical related bookmarks stored out there! It is a great resource!

Who knows, my blog may be blocked soon for "personal" reasons!

Who runs this junk anyway?!?

(I realize that there are completely legitimate reasons for proxies and content filters, but blocking sites for blanket personal reasons is a little ridiculous.)
