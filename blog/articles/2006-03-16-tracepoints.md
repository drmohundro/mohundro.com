title: "Tracepoints!!!"

First thing - [jfo's coding](http://blogs.msdn.com/jfoscoding/) is a great blog. I regularly find her posts very helpful and relevant to what I'm working on.  If you're not already reading her blog, you should check it out.

Second, as she says, [tracepoints ARE awesome](http://blogs.msdn.com/jfoscoding/archive/2006/03/16/553420.aspx). I had used a few of the new breakpoint features in VS2005 such as Condition and Hit Count, but I seen the "When Hit..." option yet. All I can say is, you can say goodbye to Debug.WriteLine'ing (aka "the poor man's debugger"__*__).

__*__ If you're unfamiliar with "the poor man's debugger," it is basically using output statements to determine values and flow of code. If used correctly, it can actually be very useful. It just isn't fun to remove all of that code after you're done debugging (particularly the Response.Write variety in webpages... ouch).
