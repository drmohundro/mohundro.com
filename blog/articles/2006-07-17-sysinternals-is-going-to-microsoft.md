Earlier today, <A href="http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2006/07/on-my-way-to-microsoft.html">Mark Russinovich announced that Microsoft had acquired Winternals and Sysinternals</A>. In other words, some of the best administration tools available will be moving to Microsoft. Not only that, but by having Mark on board at Microsoft, they will have a great developer working with them. I think that this is a great move as far as bringing Mark on board. As far as acquiring Winternals and Sysinternals, I'm excited about that as well, so long as the products continue to be supported by Microsoft. I'm quite confident they will, too, because I know that Microsoft uses a lot of their tools as well (i.e. Process Explorer, RegMon, FileMon, etc). <BR><BR>Congratulations and I look forward to hearing more!<BR>
