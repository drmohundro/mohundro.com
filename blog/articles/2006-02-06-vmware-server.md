There has been a lot of talk recently about VMware releasing a version of their VMware server product for free. The [beta version](http://www.vmware.com/products/server/) was released today, though the big news to me is that there are a multitude of free "pre-built, ready-to-run virtual appliances" available for use with VMware server. Of course, as these "appliances" are free, don't expect to see a Windows VM image. It WOULD be a good way to easily play around with different versions of Linux like Red Hat or Ubuntu. I'm curious how Microsoft will respond with their Virtual PC product.
