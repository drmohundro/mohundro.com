So, want to improve at what you're doing? 
In a phrase, don't stop learning. 
In my profession (software development), this is even more important, because the field sure isn't going to wait for you. Jeremy Miller posted about how [developers need to get out and "see the world."](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/03/15/More-from-the-MVP-Summit_3A00_--Go-forth-and-see-the-world_2100_.aspx) He was specifically talking about checking out other technologies like Ruby because it can help to see how things can be done differently, but he makes one statement that I liked in particular: <blockquote> 
Software development is still a young profession that's in a state of constant flux and it's just not smart to put your head in the sand. 
... 
Yeah, I know, we all want work to end at 5 pm.  But development is the profession we chose, and <strong><em>if constant learning doesn't suit you, it's time to move onto something else</em></strong>.
</blockquote> 
This reminds me of a phrase that Scott Hanselman used in his recent [podcast on "Hiring and Interviewing Engineers."](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=69) Here's the relevant snippet from the podcast: <blockquote> 
<strong>Scott Hanselman:</strong> ... I also ask<br>people about what blogs they read, what books<br>they read, how do they become <strong><em>lifelong<br>learners</em></strong>...<br><br><strong>Carl Franklin:</strong> Yeah, very important.<br><br><strong>Scott Hanselman:</strong> ...because it is not that you<br>want them to be people who are necessarily<br>working on Open Source projects at night, but<br>they should be enthused; they should be stoked<br>about whatever they are working on.
</blockquote> 
I actually typically use my lunch hour to catch up on feeds, which are an excellent source of continuing learning. As far as books... well, I've got like 5 or 6 at home that I need to read. I still need to work on that. 
What are your tips on continual learning? 
(man, this post reads a lot like those cheesy "the more you know" commercials from TV... sorry...)
