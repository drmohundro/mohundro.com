I didn't expect to add a Speaking category to my blog just yet, but... well, here it is, my premiere Speaking post. 

I’ll be presenting on [PowerShell](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx) to the [Fort Smith .NET User Group](http://fsdnug.org/) next Monday. The talk will be an introduction level talk, but I plan on covering quite a bit if time allows. My primary focus (goal) will be on how PowerShell can make us as developers be more productive, whether that is from script automation or just learning to more efficient by using our keyboards more. 

If you’re in the area, drop by! You can even heckle me if you want! 

I’m planning on posting the slides and examples after the presentation.
