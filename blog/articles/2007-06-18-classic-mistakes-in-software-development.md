<p>I just completed the <a href="https://vovici.com/wsb.dll/s/10431g2996e">Classic Mistakes survey from Construx</a>. Thanks to Jeff Atwood for <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000889.html">pointing this one out</a>.</p> <p>The survey itself didn't seem particularly helpful, but the questions it poses do help in enumerating many of the problems I've experienced by actually putting them into words. </p> <p>It also is beneficial to me because some of these&nbsp;mistakes&nbsp;stem from the developers instead of the management. I've been&nbsp;guilty of developer gold-plating and the silver-bullet syndrome many times, which is likely a result of being a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:www.mohundro.com+beta&amp;hl=en&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N">beta</a> <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/2006/01/26/TheAToZOfProgrammerPredilictions.aspx">junkie</a>. We're in the process of moving to .NET 2.0 (no, not even .NET 3.0 or 3.5 yet) and I'm already jumping to move to Visual Studio 2008 (formerly Orcas). I mean, surely WPF, Linq, and WCF would solve all of our problems wouldn't they? Or, if we suddenly went 100%&nbsp;with Test Driven Development, all of our problems would disappear! Wouldn't they?</p> <p>Sam Gentile's comments on <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2007/06/17/writing-maintainable-code.aspx">writing maintainable code</a> are very relevant to silver-bullet syndrome. He points out that the XP methodology revolves around 12 practices and not TDD by itself. TDD isn't a silver bullet but instead is a tool to help document and protect your codebase. You also have to work at refactoring your code and keep it clean and simple.</p> <p>I haven't ever worked in an XP/Agile environment before, but I do like the goals that it strives for. I'm really pushing my team to learn more about architecture, design, and unit testing because I really do see the value. We really have to just start using these tools. Otherwise, we'll keep talking about them and never actually do anything.</p> <p>Thank goodness for all these tech blogs. I've learned more from reading these in the past couple of years than I have from just about anything else. It's almost like I'm being mentored by all of the more experienced developers.</p>
