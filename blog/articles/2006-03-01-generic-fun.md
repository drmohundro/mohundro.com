Thanks to a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000526.html">post</a> from <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Jeff Atwood</a>, I discovered the blog of <a href="http://www.dotnet2themax.com/blogs/fbalena/">Francesco Belana</a>. He's the author of some great books including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735620598/002-6859461-5348836?v=glance&amp;n=283155">Programming Visual Basic.NET</a>, which my company has been using to get our developers up to speed on .NET.<br /><br />I'd like to point out a couple of posts of his that give great examples of using generics in .NET 2.0.<br /><br />Check them out:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.dotnet2themax.com/blogs/fbalena/PermaLink,guid,b2a8f5e9-ddf1-45eb-ad8e-78c88c13ab2f.aspx">Tricks with delegates</a></li><li><a href="http://www.dotnet2themax.com/blogs/fbalena/PermaLink,guid,dc5f6b89-623e-45b6-80ca-0eee79a21faf.aspx">Generic enough to be useful</a></li></ul>
