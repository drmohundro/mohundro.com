Thanks to a [post](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000526.html) from [Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/), I discovered the blog of [Francesco Belana](http://www.dotnet2themax.com/blogs/fbalena/). He's the author of some great books including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735620598/002-6859461-5348836?v=glance&n=283155">Programming Visual Basic.NET</a>, which my company has been using to get our developers up to speed on .NET.<br><br>I'd like to point out a couple of posts of his that give great examples of using generics in .NET 2.0.<br><br>Check them out:<br><ul>
