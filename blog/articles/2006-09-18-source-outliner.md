<p>Recently, Microsoft released <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=7e0fdd66-698a-4e6a-b373-bd0642847ab7&amp;DisplayLang=en">version 3.0 of the Visual Studio 2005 SDK</a>, so I thought I'd download it because I like downloading stuff.</p> <p>Anyway, I thought I'd share a nifty tool that came along with it under the Visual Studio SDK Power Toys name (not to be confused with the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/powertoys/default.aspx">Power Toys for Visual Studio</a>... I'm confused, too). Here's a screenshot of Source Outliner:</p> <p><img alt="Source Outliner" src="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/2006-09-19-SourceOutliner.png"></p> <p>It acts sort of like the Class View tool window, except that it outlines the currently opened file. It also seems a lot cleaner if you happen to be deep in a namespace hierarchy. Once you have the VS2005 SDK installed, you can access this tool either by selecting Tools -&gt; Power Toys -&gt; Source Outliner or by using the CTRL + \ + O hotkey.</p> <p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=7e0fdd66-698a-4e6a-b373-bd0642847ab7&amp;DisplayLang=en">Check it out</a>!</p><p><b>UPDATE:</b> I... uhh... added the link to the download. My mistake on forgetting that :-)</p><p><b>Another update:</b> Don't bother downloading the entire SDK if you're just interested in the Visual Studio SDK Power Toys... you can download them standalone!
