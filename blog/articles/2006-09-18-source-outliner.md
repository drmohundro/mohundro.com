title: "Source Outliner"

Recently, Microsoft released [version 3.0 of the Visual Studio 2005 SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=7e0fdd66-698a-4e6a-b373-bd0642847ab7&DisplayLang=en), so I thought I'd download it because I like downloading stuff. 

Anyway, I thought I'd share a nifty tool that came along with it under the Visual Studio SDK Power Toys name (not to be confused with the [Power Toys for Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/powertoys/default.aspx)... I'm confused, too). Here's a screenshot of Source Outliner:

It acts sort of like the Class View tool window, except that it outlines the currently opened file. It also seems a lot cleaner if you happen to be deep in a namespace hierarchy. Once you have the VS2005 SDK installed, you can access this tool either by selecting Tools -&gt; Power Toys -&gt; Source Outliner or by using the CTRL + \ + O hotkey. 

[Check it out](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=7e0fdd66-698a-4e6a-b373-bd0642847ab7&DisplayLang=en)!

**UPDATE:** I... uhh... added the link to the download. My mistake on forgetting that :-)

**Another update:** Don't bother downloading the entire SDK if you're just interested in the Visual Studio SDK Power Toys... you can download them standalone! Check out Aaron Marten's post [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/aaronmar/archive/2006/10/27/where-have-all-the-powertoys-gone.aspx)!
