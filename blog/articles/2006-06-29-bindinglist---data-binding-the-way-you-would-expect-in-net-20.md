title: "BindingList - data binding the way you would expect in .NET 2.0!"

<P>If anyone out there knew about the BindingList before today, I sure wish one of you would have told me. Now I know, if you had known I was looking for something like the BindingList, you would have told me, but still...<BR><BR>Okay, all joking aside, the BindingList is what I've been trying to find for a long time. With Visual Studio 2005, the option to bind to an object data source is now possible (see screenshot).</P>

<P>The typical usage&nbsp;scenario for me with this data binding option is that I have just used .NET remoting to pull a collection of business objects back from a remote server. After that, I usually&nbsp;want to bind this collection to a datagrid or something like. For the past few months, I had used the new BindingSource object and set its DataSource property to my collection (usually a System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;T&gt; or a System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection&lt;T&gt;). The problem I had was that any changes to either of those collections later would not fire ListChanged events. I had settled myself to the fact that I would have to reset the binding everytime.</P>
<P>Well, not so!</P>
<P><A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dchandnani/">Dinesh Chandnani</A> posted to his MSDN blog over a year ago about this subject. Too bad I didn't find it until today. In his <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dchandnani/archive/2005/03/12/394438.aspx">post</A>, he provides some very simple code examples, one of which details how to get a "DataGridView bound to business objects." <STRONG>*gasp!*</STRONG> Where have I been? This is what his code looks like:<SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DataGridView dgv = new DataGridView();<?xml:namespace prefix = o /><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>BindingSource bs = new BindingSource();<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN><STRONG>BindingList&lt;Customer&gt; bList = new BindingList&lt;Customer&gt;();<o:p></o:p></STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>// Fill bList with Customers<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN><STRONG>bs.DataSource = bList;<o:p></o:p></STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>dgv.DataSource = bs;</SPAN></P></SPAN>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>I wish I known about the System.ComponentModel.BindingList&lt;T&gt; before now. It would've saved me so much time. If you're still trying to bind to a List or Collection like I was, take that guy out and bind to the BindingList instead! It really works the way you would expect it to!
