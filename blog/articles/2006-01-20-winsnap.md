I know many people have seen the excellent <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/brian/articles/Cropper.aspx">Cropper</a> tool for grabbing screenshots. I found another tool very similar to it by the maker of <a href="http://www.ntwind.com/taskswitchxp/">TaskSwitchXP</a> called <a href="http://www.ntwind.com/winsnap/index.html">WinSnap</a>. It gives a few additional features like adding a dropshadow or rotating the image. The good thing is that it is still a very small application. Here is a screenshot I pulled with it:<br><br><img src="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/2006-01-21_0001.jpg"><br><br>Cool shadow effect, huh? I'm giving it a try right now. It seems to work well for me so far.<br><p></p>
