title: "Why can't I move my public folders in Vista?"

<p>I recently moved my documents from my C: drive over to my D: drive at home. My C: drive is&nbsp;a 10,000 RPM Raptor drive, which is insanely fast, but doesn't provide as much disk space (still a completely worthwhile tradeoff IMHO). As a result, though, I don't have room on my C: drive for a lot of other things like programs and games, which is why moving my documents to the D: drive is so nice. This is what it looks like in Vista:</p> <p><a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/WhycantImovemypublicfoldersinVista_113B5/image%7B0%7D%5B7%5D.png" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="503" src="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/WhycantImovemypublicfoldersinVista_113B5/image%7B0%7D_thumb%5B3%5D.png" width="377" border="0"></a> </p> <p>Now, notice the buttons on this screenshot, specifically the "Restore Default," "Move," and "Find Target" buttons. Do you see them in&nbsp;the screenshot below?</p> <p><a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/WhycantImovemypublicfoldersinVista_113B5/image%7B0%7D%5B10%5D.png" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="503" src="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/WhycantImovemypublicfoldersinVista_113B5/image%7B0%7D_thumb%5B4%5D.png" width="377" border="0"></a> </p> <p>I don't!!!</p> <p>Where are they?!?</p> <p>The only difference that I can tell is that the one is for my personal folder and the other is for the Public folder... is it a security setting? I'm not sure, but I tried running Windows Explorer as an Administrator and it still didn't work. I'm currently running build 5600 (RC1).</p> <p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=233109">I'm not the only one to experience this behavior.</a></p>
