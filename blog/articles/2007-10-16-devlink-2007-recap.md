My wife and I got back from Nashville last night and we had a great time. While she went around shopping at garage sales and hanging out with family, I got to spend some time with some great developers at [devLink](http://devlink.net/). The conference was incredible. I'm still amazed that they were able to do so much with only $50, but no complaints here :-) 
Here are a few of the high points from the conference: 
[Keith Elder](http://keithelder.net/blog/default.aspx) had a great presentation on the Enterprise Library. It was especially good to hear from someone who is using EntLib successfully from a WinForms perspective. I also got to talk to him a little after his presentation on some of their techniques for storing configuration across smart client applications. 
[Josh Holmes](http://www.joshholmes.com/Default.aspx) is a great speaker. I'm not at all surprised that he is one of the hosts for the new [Code To Live!](http://www.codetolive.net/) show. He is clearly passionate about the coding craft. He shared some great information about the DLR with us. 
I got to hear [Dave Laribee](http://codebetter.com/blogs/david_laribee/) talk about Domain Driven Design, which was great. I also spoke with him about ALT.NET and Microsoft's upcoming MVC framework for ASP.NET. He told me that there are already plans for the next ALT.NET conference which is great news. 
[Ron Jacobs](http://www.ronjacobs.com/) had the closing keynote on Saturday evening that covered Test Driven Development and the Model View Presenter architecture. It was a great presentation and it was encouraging to have Microsoft's presence there encouraging and pushing TDD. 
One of the best things about the conference was how approachable everyone was. I got to meet a lot of great people and I even got the change to give [Colin](http://www.colinneller.com/blog/) grief about winning the blogging contest (not that you can give someone much grief about winning an Xbox 360). My only complaint was that I wasn't able to attend some of the other presentations where there were schedule conflicts. 
All in all, the conference was great. The staff and the presenters all did a great job.
