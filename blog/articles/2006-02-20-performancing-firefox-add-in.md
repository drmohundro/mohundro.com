I just installed the [Performancing Add-in](https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=1730) today and it is pretty snazzy. It seems to work fine with dasBlog, which is exactly what I need. It supports categories and will also pull in previous posts and allow you to edit them. It also has <b>some </b><i>pretty</i> <u>good</u> formatting capabilities. If you can read this post, then I can highly recommend Performancing!

**UPDATE**: It worked fine... I like it a lot! A very quick and easy way to blog, and from within your browser, too! Sweet!
