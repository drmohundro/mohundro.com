I remember the first time I ran into an ASP.NET error talking about event validation (specifically while playing with CommunityServer). The solution I discovered at the time was to just disable event validation by setting enableEventValidation to false in the web.config file.

Well, thanks to a couple of posts from [K. Scott Allen](http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/default.aspx), I now have a much better understanding of event validation and why it is a really good thing. Check out his posts [here](http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/archive/2006/03/20/3145.aspx) and [here](http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/archive/2006/03/21/3153.aspx).

Thanks Scott!
