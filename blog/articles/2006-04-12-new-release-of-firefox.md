Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.2 was released today. At first glance, it seems to be a lot more stable than 1.5.0.1. I had all sorts of issues with the last version randomly crashing on me. In their defense, it seemed to be a combination of some of the extensions I was using and the corporate proxy. I never had any problems at home using the same extensions.
