Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.2 was released today. At first glance, it seems to be a lot more stable than 1.5.0.1. I had all sorts of issues with the last version randomly crashing on me. In their defense, it seemed to be a combination of some of the extensions I was using and the corporate proxy. I never had any problems at home using the same extensions.<br /><br />Check it <a href="ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.5.0.2/win32/en-US/Firefox%20Setup%201.5.0.2.exe">out</a>.<br /><br />(<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/neowin-software?m=403">via Neowin.net Software</a>)<br />
