If you've never seen some of the posts from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/okoboji/">Kevin Moore</a> regarding WPF (<a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/PermaLink.aspx/848ef1d4-f694-43ee-92f7-047478b6b894">commonly pronounced Avalon</a>), you should definitely check them out. In particular, some of the things you can do with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/okoboji/archive/2006/02/23/538340.aspx">ListViews and XAML</a> are incredible! He points to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/atc_avalon_team/archive/2006/02/23/537715.aspx">this post</a> to show some of the XAML that is required and, really, it doesn't look that bad. To get something like that out of the built-in ListView in .NET 1.1 or .NET 2.0, you would have to do some owner-drawn madness... or do the entire thing yourself.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but I'm looking forward to WPF!<br />
