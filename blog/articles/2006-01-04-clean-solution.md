Has anyone noticed a new menu item under the Build menu in Visual Studio 2005? There is a Clean Solution item that will remove all of the compiled binaries that live under your bin folder. It is relatively similar to [Clean Sources Plus](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000368.html), except that it keeps the folders.

Note: I'm not sure if it shows up in every VS configuration. I'm using the default view (see Tools -&gt; Import and Export Settings).
