So, want to improve at what you're doing? 

In a phrase, don't stop learning. 

In my profession (software development), this is even more important, because the field sure isn't going to wait for you. Jeremy Miller posted about how [developers need to get out and "see the world."](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/03/15/More-from-the-MVP-Summit_3A00_--Go-forth-and-see-the-world_2100_.aspx) He was specifically talking about checking out other technologies like Ruby because it can help to see how things can be done differently, but he makes one statement that I liked in particular:

> Software development is still a young profession that's in a state of constant flux and it's just not smart to put your head in the sand.

> ...

> Yeah, I know, we all want work to end at 5 pm.  But development is the profession we chose, and <strong><em>if constant learning doesn't suit you, it's time to move onto something else</em></strong>.

This reminds me of a phrase that Scott Hanselman used in his recent [podcast on "Hiring and Interviewing Engineers."](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=69) Here's the relevant snippet from the podcast: 

> **Scott Hanselman:** ... I also ask people about what blogs they read, what books they read, how do they become ***lifelong learners***...

> **Carl Franklin:** Yeah, very important.

> **Scott Hanselman:** ...because it is not that you<br>want them to be people who are necessarily working on Open Source projects at night, but they should be enthused; they should be stoked about whatever they are working on.

I actually typically use my lunch hour to catch up on feeds, which are an excellent source of continuing learning. As far as books... well, I've got like 5 or 6 at home that I need to read. I still need to work on that. 

What are your tips on continual learning? 

(man, this post reads a lot like those cheesy "the more you know" commercials from TV... sorry...)
