<P>I ran into that error today while attempting to install Infragistics NetAdvantage 2005. I'm not exactly sure about why the error occurred, but I was able to find a fix <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/chetanc/default.aspx">here</A>&nbsp;(via <A href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PageIndex=1&amp;SiteID=1&amp;PostID=124977">this</A> MSDN forum&nbsp;thread). Some of the other solutions appear to be reinstalling VS2005, but luckily, the registry fixes from Chetan's blog worked fine.</P>
