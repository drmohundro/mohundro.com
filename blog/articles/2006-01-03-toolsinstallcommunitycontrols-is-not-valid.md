I ran into that error today while attempting to install Infragistics NetAdvantage 2005. I'm not exactly sure about why the error occurred, but I was able to find a fix [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/chetanc/default.aspx) (via <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PageIndex=1&SiteID=1&PostID=124977">this</a> MSDN forum thread). Some of the other solutions appear to be reinstalling VS2005, but luckily, the registry fixes from Chetan's blog worked fine.
