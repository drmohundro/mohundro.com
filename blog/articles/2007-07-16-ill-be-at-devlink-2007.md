I'm pretty excited this year, because I'll be going to my first developer conference. [devLink 2007](http://www.devlink.net/) will be held in Nashville, TN on October 12 and 13. You can't beat the return that you'll get from this conference because, for the low, low price of $50, you'll get to hear from such speakers at [Brad Abrams](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/default.aspx), [Scott Bellware](http://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/default.aspx), [Jean-Paul S. Boodhoo](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jean-paul_boodhoo/default.aspx), and [Rockford Lhotka](http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/) just to name a few. All this for $50!!! 

Even if you can't get your employer to pay for this conference (I don't know if mine is or not yet), it would still be worth it to check this out. Besides, you can go see the [Parthenon](http://www.nashville.gov/parthenon/) while in Nashville. Having seen the original, I'd say Nashville's copy is pretty cool, too. 

Evan Hoff [posted about the conference](http://evanhoff.com/archive/2007/07/07/29.aspx) and his post [already has 13 kicks on DotNetKicks](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/community/DevLink_2007_A_world_class_conference_you_can_afford), so excitement about the conference is building. Sign up now! 

Leave a comment or email me if you're planning on going. It'd be great to meet some of the other developers out there.
