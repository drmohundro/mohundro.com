<p></p> <p></p> <p><a href="http://www.colinneller.com/blog/">Colin</a> is risking it I say. How is he risking it you might ask? By asking me to speak to the <a href="http://mnug.net/blogs/news/archive/2008/09/01/next-meeting-thursday-september-25-2008-6-00-pm.aspx">Memphis .NET User Group</a>!</p> <p>I think he’s crazy, but whatever.</p> <p><a href="http://www.mysoftwarestartup.com/">Randy Walker</a> and I <a href="http://www.mysoftwarestartup.com/blogs/general/archive/2008/09/20/memphis-net-user-group-visit-sept-25th.aspx">will be traveling to Memphis, TN</a> tomorrow night where I’ll be presenting on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx">PowerShell</a>. Randy is coming out to meet with the founding members of the Northeast Arkansas .NET User Group, which is very cool. Regarding my presentation, it will likely be a similar presentation to what I gave to the <a href="http://fsdnug.org/">FSDNUG</a> group, but I’m hoping to have more script examples. I think I gave the Fort Smith group a good picture of PowerShell, but I don’t think I showed them nearly as many practical uses of PowerShell as I would have liked. I’ve got a folder of scripts now, some that I’ve written for myself and a few that we’re using at work, that I’ll be showing and walking through during the presentation.</p> <p>If you’re in the area, come on out!</p>
