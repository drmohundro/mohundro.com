[Colin](http://www.colinneller.com/blog/) is risking it I say. How is he risking it you might ask? By asking me to speak to the [Memphis .NET User Group](http://mnug.net/blogs/news/archive/2008/09/01/next-meeting-thursday-september-25-2008-6-00-pm.aspx)! 
I think he’s crazy, but whatever. 
[Randy Walker](http://www.mysoftwarestartup.com/) and I [will be traveling to Memphis, TN](http://www.mysoftwarestartup.com/blogs/general/archive/2008/09/20/memphis-net-user-group-visit-sept-25th.aspx) tomorrow night where I’ll be presenting on [PowerShell](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx). Randy is coming out to meet with the founding members of the Northeast Arkansas .NET User Group, which is very cool. Regarding my presentation, it will likely be a similar presentation to what I gave to the [FSDNUG](http://fsdnug.org/) group, but I’m hoping to have more script examples. I think I gave the Fort Smith group a good picture of PowerShell, but I don’t think I showed them nearly as many practical uses of PowerShell as I would have liked. I’ve got a folder of scripts now, some that I’ve written for myself and a few that we’re using at work, that I’ll be showing and walking through during the presentation. 
If you’re in the area, come on out!
