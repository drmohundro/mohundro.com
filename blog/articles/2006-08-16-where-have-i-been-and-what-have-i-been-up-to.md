I'm sorry... I've been bad about posting lately. So bad in fact, that I've only posted once this month! But you know what? I've got a good excuse... I was in Alaska on vacation! So there! 

I plan on putting pictures on [mine and my wife's blog](http://www.mohundro.com/) soon if anyone is interested in seeing what Alaska looks like. It is a lot cooler there, which was a huge plus over the 100+ (Fahrenheit) temperature here. 

Anyway, I wanted to also say that I've been a [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) junkie lately, too. I didn't know until fairly recently that you could subscribe to OTHER users' bookmarks and see what they're watching. That feature is downright cool. It gives you a glimpse of what other people find interesting and it is even faster than watching blog posts, because people tend to bookmark things before posting about them. I do. My del.icio.us page is at [http://del.icio.us/drmohundro](http://del.icio.us/drmohundro) if anyone is interested in checking it out. The RSS feed is at the bottom. 

Does anyone else use del.icio.us regularly? If so, leave your del.icio.us IDs! 
(PS - this post comes to you from Windows Live Writer... too bad it doesn't work through my corporate proxy, either...)
