I'm off to [.NET Roadshow 2007](http://www.dotnetroadshow.com/) in Dallas! The speakers are Juval L&ouml;wy, Mich&egrave;le Leroux Bustamante, and Brian Noyes. My hope is we'll be doing some pretty heavy .NET 3.0 development at work soon (primarily WPF and WCF I would guess), so watch for some .NET 3.0 related content. I'll post when I get back about how it was and, if I get a chance, I'll try to post some updates from the conference as well.
