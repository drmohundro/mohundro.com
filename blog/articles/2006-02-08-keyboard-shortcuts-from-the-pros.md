[Visual Studio Hacks](http://www.visualstudiohacks.com/) posted a new "Ask the Pros" article detailing some of the pros' favorite keyboard shortcuts. Check it out [here](http://www.visualstudiohacks.com/atpkeyboard). There are quite a few good shortcuts in there, like the Comment and Uncomment code blocks (`Ctrl-K-C` and `Ctrl-K-U` respectively). Some of my new favorites have to do with additional functionality provided by snippets in Visual Studio 2005, specifically the `Edit.SurroundWith` command, which is `Ctrl-K-S` by default. It makes it a cinch to add code to new regions, much like the [Visual Studio 2003 Region add-in](http://www.colinneller.com/blog/ct.ashx?id=40aced4b-d554-4bec-997b-57ead66add7e&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.codeproject.com%2fdotnet%2fRegionsAddIn.asp). As the article says, a nice way to learn more shortcuts is to check them out in Visual Studio for yourself - under Tools, Options, and Keyboard.
