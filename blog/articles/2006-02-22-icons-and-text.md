title: "Icons AND Text!"

<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Jeff Atwood</a> posted a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000523.html">very interesting article</a> today detailing the effects of icons, text, and combinations of the two in toolbars. I particularly liked his comparison of using different icon sets for toolbars. The image of Word with all possible toolbars displayed was particularly horrifying, though.<br /><br />There is something to be said for having both icons and text. I think of Outlook a few years ago versus Outlook today. I believe Outlook 97 defaulted to just displaying icons. It was also one of the most complicated email programs out there. Today, Outlook is my preferred email client, and it has a nice combination of displaying ToolStrip items with icons and text both. The text tells us exactly what it does, but the icons do have meaning. I keep thinking back to all of the comments to posts on the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie">IEBlog</a>. There was a lot of positive response to the standardization of the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rssteam/archive/2005/12/14/503778.aspx">RSS icon</a>. There have been a lot of negative responses to some of the changes to the other IE icons, though, in particularly the combination of refresh and stop that they had prior to the Beta 2 Preview. (that might have more to do with having one button do multiple things, though).<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, an interesting post, so check it out!
