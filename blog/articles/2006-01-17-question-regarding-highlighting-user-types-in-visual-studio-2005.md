I was curious if anyone knew if Visual Studio 2005 had the capability to highlight or color "User Types" (i.e. classes you write yourself) while coding in Visual Basic. I know that C# has this functionality built in, but it doesn't seem like VB pays any heed to those settings. Here's a screenshot of the specific setting in Visual Studio:<br><br><img src="http://mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/2006-01-18_0001.jpeg"><br><br>If anyone knows anything about getting that working for VB, I'd appreciate it.<br>
