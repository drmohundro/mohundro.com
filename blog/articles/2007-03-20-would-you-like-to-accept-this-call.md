This is completely off-topic, but I thought it was pretty funny. 

I had this past Monday off from work and when I got into the office today, I noticed that I had a voicemail. As a programmer, that usually isn't a good sign, because many times it means a user has tried to call to let you know about a problem. When I noticed the message was left on Saturday morning, that made it seem even worse. 

Then I actually listened to the message. 

"If you would like to accept this call, please press 3... now." 

I won't give you the rest of the message. Needless to say, hearing that prerecorded voice telling me my options for a collect call that I wasn't able to accept made me feel much better about my day. 

I hope a user wasn't trying to call me collect.
