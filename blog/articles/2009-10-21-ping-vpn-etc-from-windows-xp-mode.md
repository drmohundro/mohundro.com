<p>I just wanted to share a quick tip on something that had been tripping me up. I’ve happily been running Windows 7 x64 for around a month now. At work, our VPN hardware doesn’t support 64-bit (different topic, don’t ask), so I wanted to use the VPN client from within Windows XP Mode. Sounds good, right?</p> <p>One problem. The VPN client couldn’t see outside networks. In fact, I couldn’t even ping.</p> <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Attempting to ping  from XPM" border="0" alt="Attempting to ping  from XPM" src="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/PingVPNetcfromWindowsXPMode_12ADF/image_3.png" width="644" height="185"></p> <p> The default networking adapter seems to be “Shared Networking (NAT)” – just change it to your actual network adapter.</p> <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Networking adapter settings" border="0" alt="Networking adapter settings" src="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/PingVPNetcfromWindowsXPMode_12ADF/image_6.png" width="644" height="433"> </p> <p>Success!</p> <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Successful ping!" border="0" alt="Successful ping!" src="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/PingVPNetcfromWindowsXPMode_12ADF/image_9.png" width="644" height="277"></p>
