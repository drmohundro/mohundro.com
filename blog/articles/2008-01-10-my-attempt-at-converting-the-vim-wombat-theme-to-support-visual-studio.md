<p>I absolutely love trying out different Visual Studio color schemes. I've used <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2007/06/vibrant_ink_vis.html">John Lam's port of Vibrant</a> for a while as well as some of <a href="http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2007/11/22/VS2008ColorSchemes.aspx">Tomas Restrepo's VS themes</a> and they're all great. After watching <a href="http://blog.eleutian.com/2007/12/13/VimScreencastTutorialTeaser.aspx">this VIM screencast from the Eleutian guys</a>, I decided to give VIM another try. I'm not able to fly with it yet, but I am picking it up a lot better.</p> <p>One of the things that I absolutely love about <a href="http://www.vim.org/">VIM</a> as well as <a href="http://www.e-texteditor.com/">E-TextEditor</a> is how it comes preloaded with some great color schemes. Not only that, but both editors are ridiculously easy to pull down new schemes from the internet. I've never really cared for editing the colors in Visual Studio, but I decided that I had to try to port <a href="http://dengmao.wordpress.com/2007/01/22/vim-color-scheme-wombat/">Wombat</a> over to Visual Studio. It is the theme that Aaron is using in the video and it looks great.</p> <p>Here is what it looks like in VIM:</p> <p><a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/MyattemptatconvertingtheVIMWombatthemeto_A345/gvimwombat_4.png"><img style="border-width: 0px;" alt="gvimwombat" src="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/MyattemptatconvertingtheVIMWombatthemeto_A345/gvimwombat_thumb_1.png" border="0" height="254" width="687"></a> </p> <p>Here is what my port looks like:</p> <p><a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/MyattemptatconvertingtheVIMWombatthemeto_A345/vswombat_2.png"><img style="border-width: 0px;" alt="vswombat" src="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/MyattemptatconvertingtheVIMWombatthemeto_A345/vswombat_thumb.png" border="0" height="242" width="641"></a> </p> <p>As you can tell, some of the colors don't exactly match up; however, I think it keeps the overall feel and I like it. Try it out and let me know what you think. If you'd like to make some improvements, make them and then send me a copy!</p> <p>Download <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/Wombat2005.zip">my attempt at a Visual Studio Wombat theme (VS2005)</a>.<br>Download <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/Wombat2008.zip">my attempt at a Visual Studio Wombat theme (VS2008)</a>.</p>
