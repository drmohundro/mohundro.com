title: "Trackback Spam Deluge!"

I finally had to disable trackbacks on my blog. Even with some of the antispam features of dasBlog, I was still getting hit like crazy. Just today, I got about 150 spam trackbacks to 3 or 4 of my posts. And I'm even running version 1.9.6264.0! I did notice <a href="http://briandela.com/blog/archive/2005/06/29/652.aspx">this post</a> about an HttpModule that will block trackbacks based on regular expression patterns. I was curious if anyone else had used this or another method to effectively fight (or even prevent) trackback spam. Or maybe I'm just missing an updated blacklist for my configuration.<br><br>Help anyone?<br><br><b>UPDATE:</b> Thanks to a <a href="http://www.timrayburn.net/2006/10/17/Upgrading+To+DasBlog+196288.aspx">post</a> from <a href="http://www.timrayburn.net/default.aspx">Tim Rayburn</a> (and a comment directing me there!), it looks like the newest nightly build of dasBlog supports Akismet -- and Akismet apparently also supports better Trackback spam blocking! Looks like I might be dogfooding the latest build of dasBlog soon!<br><p></p>
