For your enjoyment, here is some great dialogue from the movie [Airplane](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080339/). Why am I providing this? Because it is funny and because I wanted to. 
<strong>Roger Murdock:</strong> We have clearance, Clarence. <br><strong>Capt. Clarence Oveur:</strong> Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor? <br><strong>Tower:</strong> Tower Radio, clearance, over. <br><strong>Oveur: </strong>That's 'Clarence Oveur', over. <br><strong>Tower: </strong>Roger. <br><strong>Roger Murdock: </strong>Huh? <br><strong>Tower: </strong>Roger, over. <br><strong>Roger Murdock: </strong>What? <br><strong>Capt. Oveur: </strong>Huh?  
Many thanks to Kaelin for providing this.
