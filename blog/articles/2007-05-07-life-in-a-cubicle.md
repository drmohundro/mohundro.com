I've already shared with you about how [cubicles really can be annoying when you sit next to the loudest two individuals in the world](http://www.mohundro.com/blog/2006/08/27/NoisyWorkingConditions.aspx).

Now, I'd like to point you to a video that Long Zheng posted (from [istartedsomething](http://www.istartedsomething.com/)) from when [Conan O'Brien visited Intel headquarters](http://www.istartedsomething.com/20070506/conan-intel-video/).

Here are some similarities between Intel and where I work: 

1. Cubicles really are like parking garages, except that you have assigned spots.
2. Cubicles really don't have much color or individuality (I do have a National Geographic map on my cubicle wall, though - yay!).
3. People really are picky about their chairs. Seriously picky.

Here are some differences between Intel and where I work:

1. No cafeteria.
2. No "ultra-clean" factory.
3. Hairnets only come into play on Halloween.
4. I haven't ever seen kids on a field trip, though we do have kids come around our cubes to sell cookies sometimes (and on Halloween).

One other thing - I think I've met [Bill Lumbergh's](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/) clone in our cubicle farm. I'm guessing any and all work environments that make use of cubes have their Bill Lumberghs.
