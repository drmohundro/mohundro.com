I've [blogged about FileHelpers](http://www.mohundro.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,78c670c2-8cd1-4430-8d40-c559fa315149.aspx) before. I like it a lot.<br><br>Since then, Marcos has added even more great features to it including support for .NET 2.0 Generics and a new Wizard application that really increases the speed in developing new records.<br><br>Marcos has an [article](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/filehelpers.asp) up on [CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/) as well as a FileHelpers [website](http://filehelpers.sourceforge.net/) with examples and a support forum.<br><br>Seriously, if you're still using String.Substring calls to parse out flat files, give the library a try.<br>
