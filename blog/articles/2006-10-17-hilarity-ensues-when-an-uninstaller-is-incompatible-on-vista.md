Okay, maybe it isn't hilarity, but it is somewhat ridiculous when Vista will let you get around a compatibility dialog warning you that a program isn't currently compatible on this version of Windows but a similar dialog that is displayed when you try to _uninstall_ the same application that _will not let you override it *_! 

At least as far as I can tell - YMMV. 

(I wish I had thought to take screenshots... I did a quick search online but didn't come up with any examples of the dialogs I mentioned... sorry) 

_*_ I was installing/uninstalling Nero 6... installing so that I could copy a CD and uninstalling so I could install Nero 7, which is now supported on Vista.
