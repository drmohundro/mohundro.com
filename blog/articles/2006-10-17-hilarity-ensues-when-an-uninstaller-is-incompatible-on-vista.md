<p>Okay, maybe it isn't hilarity, but it is somewhat ridiculous when Vista will let you get around a compatibility dialog warning you that a program isn't currently compatible on this version of Windows but a similar dialog that is displayed when you try to <em>uninstall</em> the same application that&nbsp;<em>will not let you override it<strong>*</strong></em>!</p> <p>At least as far as I can tell -&nbsp;YMMV.</p> <p>(I wish I had thought to take screenshots... I did a quick search online but didn't come up with any examples of the dialogs I mentioned... sorry)</p> <p><strong>*</strong> I was installing/uninstalling Nero 6... installing so that I could copy a CD and uninstalling so I could install Nero 7, which is now supported on Vista.</p>
