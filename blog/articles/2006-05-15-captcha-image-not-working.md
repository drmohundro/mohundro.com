Marcos, thanks for the heads up on the captcha image not working...<br /><br />I just tried the comment link myself and it failed. I copied the source for the image it was trying to load and the page I got gave me an error about XML parsing - "no element found". Anyone else having any problems with dasBlog and the captcha image not working?<br /><br />Am I running an older version? Has there been an update?<br /><br />I finally got the captcha image up, but it would appear it was more because of my persistence than actually changing anything (aka I kept clicking comments... <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/alberteins133991.html">something about definition of insanity</a>...).<br />
