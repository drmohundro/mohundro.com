I'm getting ready to start the drive to Nashville tonight for [DevLink 2007](http://www.devlink.net/). It will be my first real conference to attend and I'm really excited about it. It will also be fun to get to hang out in Nashville. If you'll be at the conference, look me up! 

I know a few of you who are planning on going so you have no excuses to not say hi when you're there! :-)
