I was reading through my feeds this morning and came across this gem of a paragraph: 

> Manual testing is immoral. Not only is it high stress, tedious, and error prone; itâ€™s just wrong to turn humans into machines. If you can write a script for a test procedure, then you can write a program to execute that procedure. That program will be cheaper, faster, and more accurate than a human, and will free the human to do what humans to best: *create!*

The paragraph is actually an aside to the rest of the post, too! Go read the [entire TDD post in context](http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2007/10/17/tdd-with-acceptance-tests-and-unit-tests) at the [ObjectMentor blogs](http://blog.objectmentor.com/).
