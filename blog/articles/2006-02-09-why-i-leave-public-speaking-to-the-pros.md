[Rory Blyth](http://neopoleon.com/blog/), the man who brought us the "steel cage death match" of the [Avalon authors](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/17092.aspx), tells us what happens [when public speaking goes wrong](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/17449.aspx). The way I see it, if you never get in the car in the first place, you can't ever run someone over. Let someone else do the driving.

(My driving comments were an allusion to his post... I do drive my car each and every day to work... in case you were wondering...)
