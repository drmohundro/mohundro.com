Tonight, I presented on [PowerShell](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx) to the [Fort Smith .NET User Group](http://fsdnug.org/). It was my first presentation/speech since college! Fortunately, it seems to have gone over well and I think I helped drive some interest in PowerShell. Here are my slides and other relevant links for any of those who attended.

[Start-Demo script](http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2007/03/06/improved-start-demo-script.aspx) that I used to automate some of the demos 
Many thanks to [Chris Green](http://blogs.msdn.com/chris.green/) for allowing me to use some of the content from the presentation that [he shared at Tech Ed 2007 Australia](http://blogs.msdn.com/chris.green/archive/2007/12/17/presentation-and-demo-material-an-introduction-to-powershell.aspx). Thanks also to Ben Pearce for his great [PowerShell cheat sheet](http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2007/01/24/powershell-cheat-sheet.aspx). Final thanks to [Michael Paladino](http://www.mpaladino.com/) for helping me with a run-through of my presentation ahead of time. 
I've zipped up my PowerPoint presentation along with my demo.txt (to go along with the Start-Demo script), the source for my PipelineDemo program, and my custom ps1xml file. You can get the [zip with the presentation contents here](http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/2008-09-08-fsdnug-powershell-presentation.zip). The PowerPoint presentation has a lot of relevant links that I didn't explicitly post here. 
I hope everyone enjoyed the talk! I enjoyed giving it!  
Let me know if you have any comments on ways that I could improve.
