<p>Tonight, I presented on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx">PowerShell</a> to the <a href="http://fsdnug.org/">Fort Smith .NET User Group</a>. It was my first presentation/speech since college! Fortunately, it seems to have gone over well and I think I helped drive some interest in PowerShell. Here are my slides and other relevant links for any of those who attended.</p> <p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx">PowerShell Homepage and Download</a></p> <p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/">PowerShell Blog</a></p> <p><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/PowerShellCX">PowerShell Community Extensions</a></p> <p><a href="http://thepowershellguy.com/blogs/posh/pages/powertab.aspx">PowerTab</a></p> <p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2007/03/06/improved-start-demo-script.aspx">Start-Demo script</a> that I used to automate some of the demos</p> <p>Many thanks to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/chris.green/">Chris Green</a> for allowing me to use some of the content from the presentation that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/chris.green/archive/2007/12/17/presentation-and-demo-material-an-introduction-to-powershell.aspx">he shared at Tech Ed 2007 Australia</a>. Thanks also to Ben Pearce for his great <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2007/01/24/powershell-cheat-sheet.aspx">PowerShell cheat sheet</a>. Final thanks to <a href="http://www.mpaladino.com/">Michael Paladino</a> for helping me with a run-through of my presentation ahead of time.</p> <p>I've zipped up my PowerPoint presentation along with my demo.txt (to go along with the Start-Demo script), the source for my PipelineDemo program, and my custom ps1xml file. You can get the <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/2008-09-08-fsdnug-powershell-presentation.zip">zip with the presentation contents here</a>. The PowerPoint presentation has a lot of relevant links that I didn't explicitly post here.</p> <p>I hope everyone enjoyed the talk! I enjoyed giving it! </p> <p>Let me know if you have any comments on ways that I could improve.</p>
