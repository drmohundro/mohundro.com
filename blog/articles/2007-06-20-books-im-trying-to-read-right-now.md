title: "Books I'm trying to read right now"

<p>I have so many books I need to read right now, it isn't even funny. In my office at home, I've got about 8+ books which I need to read, and the majority haven't even been started yet. </p> <p>One of them is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201485672">Martin Fowler's Refactoring</a>, which I'm really looking forward to. I've started <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ASP-NET-2-0-Hacks-David-Yack/dp/0764597663">ASP.NET MVP Hacks</a>, which is pretty good. I'm only up to chapter 3 or 4, but I've already seen a decent overview of the provider model that ASP.NET uses.</p> <p>At work, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Debugging-Microsoft-NET-2-0-Applications/dp/0735622027">John Robbins' Debugging Microsoft .NET 2.0 Applications</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Windows-PowerShell-Action-Bruce-Payette/dp/1932394907">Bruce Payette's Windows PowerShell in Action</a> are sitting on my desk. I haven't yet started the PowerShell book yet, but I've gotten a little ways into the debugging book. </p> <p>I just read a funny story that John Robbins provides in his debugging book about having&nbsp;what-if sessions during the project planning phase. He notes that in his prior job as a member of the Green Berets, they would have&nbsp;what-if sessions to plan for any and all contingencies. They're lives were on the line after all.&nbsp;</p> <p>He pointed out that, after moving to software development, he could get his development team really uncomfortable by asking what-if questions like, "what if Bob dies before we get through the&nbsp;requirements phase." I'll have to remember to ask some "what-if-death" questions at my next&nbsp;team meeting...</p>
