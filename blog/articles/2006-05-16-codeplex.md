Anyone checked out [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/Default.aspx) yet?

Looks like a Microsoft site for sharing open source applications, sort of like [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/), except a lot more user friendly! Apparently, it is built on Team Foundation Server, too. I just found the 1.0 release of MSBee (target .NET 1.1 with Visual Studio 2005) on there.

Check it out!
