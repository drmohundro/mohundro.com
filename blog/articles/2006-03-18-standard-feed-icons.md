As some of you may have noticed, I changed my blog's theme ever so slightly to encorporate the cool, orange feed icon:

![Feed Icon](http://www.mohundro.com/blog/images/feed-icon-32x32.gif)

It is quickly becoming the standard way to indicate to users that a feed is available for aggregation. By way of [FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com), I found the [Feed Icons](http://feedicons.com/) website, which is striving to help establish the icon as a standard. There, you can download the icon in different colors so it better fits your existing theme. If you've got a site that has a feed, you might consider updating your site to use the new icons. I believe that [FireFox](http://www.firefox.com) was the first to use the icon, but now [Internet Explorer has decided to use the icon](http://blogs.msdn.com/rssteam/archive/2005/12/14/503778.aspx) as well. Standardization is a great thing, eh?
