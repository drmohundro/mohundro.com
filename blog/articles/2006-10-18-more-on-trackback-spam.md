Earlier this week, I [posted](http://www.mohundro.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,10eb4b00-b733-47c4-996d-662d88663681.aspx) on some major problems I was having with trackback spam. By way of a comment, Tim Rayburn pointed me to his [post](http://www.mohundro.com/blog/ct.ashx?id=10eb4b00-b733-47c4-996d-662d88663681&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.timrayburn.net%2f2006%2f10%2f17%2fUpgrading%2bTo%2bDasBlog%2b196288.aspx) on Akismet support that the nightly builds of dasBlog now included. 

As a result, last night, I downloaded the latest build of dasBlog and uploaded the new binaries to my blog. Shortly thereafter, I was able to log onto my blog and see the section for Akismet. Sweet! I went ahead and signed up for a Wordpress account (by doing so, you can get a free Akismet API code). Things were looking great so I thought I'd let it go and check it the next day. 

Today is the next day and I just finished deleting about 250 spam trackbacks on various posts. Needless to say, I've disabled Trackback support on my blog again. 

My problem is that I'm not sure if I messed up on my upgrade or if there is a problem with the Akismet support... OR maybe it is because of the possibility that my web host doesn't allow web requests (see [Phil's post](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/10/17/Why_Oh_Why_Couldnt_WebPermission_Be_Part_Of_Medium_Trust.aspx) on WebPermission and Akismet in SubText). I'm not in control of the web server my blog runs on, so I wouldn't be at all surprised to find that my blog doesn't have WebPermission. I guess my problem is that I'm not really sure if that's the problem or if it is something else entirely. I'm blogging this from work over my lunch break, so I don't have time to dig through logs right now. 

I guess I'm just blogging because I'm a little down because Trackback spam won today. 

Spam is stupid.
