I wanted to put out a quick post to say thanks to [Dave Reed and his Infinities Loop blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/infinitiesloop/default.aspx). He recently moved his blog from blogger.com to weblogs.asp.net, which is great for me, because blogs on blogger.com are blocked by my corporate proxy! He's had some great content out there, particularly for those of us who haven't really had a chance to TRULY understand ASP.NET. He has a couple of great "TRULY understanding" posts: [one on ViewState](http://weblogs.asp.net/infinitiesloop/archive/2006/08/03/Truly-Understanding-Viewstate.aspx) and [another on static vs. dynamic controls](http://weblogs.asp.net/infinitiesloop/archive/2006/08/25/TRULY-Understanding-Dynamic-Controls-_2800_Part-1_2900_.aspx).<br><br>If you're like me and haven't had a chance to really dig into ASP.NET, check out his blog!<br>
