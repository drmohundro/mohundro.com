Anyone checked out <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Default.aspx">CodePlex</a> yet?<br /><br />Looks like a Microsoft site for sharing open source applications, sort of like <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>, except a lot more user friendly! Apparently, it is built on Team Foundation Server, too. I just found the 1.0 release of MSBee (target .NET 1.1 with Visual Studio 2005) on there.<br /><br />Check it out!<br />
