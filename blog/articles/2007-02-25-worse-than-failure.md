I guess <strong></strong>[Worse Than Failure](http://worsethanfailure.com/Articles/Announcement_0x3a__Website_0x2e_RenameTo(_0x201c_Worse_Than_Failure_0x201d_).aspx) fits a little better than what I had resorted to calling it on my own: "<strong>W</strong>here's <strong>t</strong>he <strong>F</strong>unction?"  
It didn't communicate the same feeling of horror and disbelief as the actual, intended acronym, but it was cleaner and easier to speak openly about among the cubicle farm :-) 
Now to get used to the new name.
