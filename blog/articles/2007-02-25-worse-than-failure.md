<p>I guess&nbsp;<strong></strong><a href="http://worsethanfailure.com/Articles/Announcement_0x3a__Website_0x2e_RenameTo(_0x201c_Worse_Than_Failure_0x201d_).aspx">Worse Than Failure</a> fits a little better than what I had resorted to calling it on my own:&nbsp;"<strong>W</strong>here's <strong>t</strong>he <strong>F</strong>unction?" </p> <p>It didn't communicate the same feeling of horror and disbelief as the actual, intended acronym, but it was cleaner and easier to speak openly about among the cubicle farm :-)</p> <p>Now to get used to the new name.</p>
