Larry O'Brien talks about the <a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,0d0da954-a465-43e7-8483-3024f7657528.aspx">myth of better programming languages</a> and how "there is <b>not</b> a shared psychology of computer programming." Seriously, it really does have to do with how you think about things. I work with people who can type all day and then compile and run their program without any errors... in COBOL. Does that mean that it is a better programming language? Maybe for them. Most definitely not for me.<br /><br />As a side note, <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/Photos.aspx?gallery=Honeymoon+in+Hawaii">Kona and the Big Island of Hawaii rule</a>.<br /><br />(found via <a href="http://www.larkware.com/dg5/TheDailyGrind825.html">the Daily Grind</a>)<br />
