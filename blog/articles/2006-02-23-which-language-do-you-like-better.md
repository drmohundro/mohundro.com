Larry O'Brien talks about the [myth of better programming languages](http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,0d0da954-a465-43e7-8483-3024f7657528.aspx) and how "there is *not* a shared psychology of computer programming." Seriously, it really does have to do with how you think about things. I work with people who can type all day and then compile and run their program without any errors... in COBOL. Does that mean that it is a better programming language? Maybe for them. Most definitely not for me.
