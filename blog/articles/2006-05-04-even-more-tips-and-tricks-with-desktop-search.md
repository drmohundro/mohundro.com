I just found another nifty shortcut to finding items in Desktop Search. Let's assume you want to find an email with test in the subject in body. If you're like me, you'll find a ton of emails because you get to test a lot of code at work. HOWEVER, what if you know it was in the past couple of days? Try this then:

kind:mail test date:&gt;5/1/2006

That will get all emails with test somewhere in it that came after May 1, 2006. Of course, you can narrow the search more by specifying test in the subject or body or whatever.
