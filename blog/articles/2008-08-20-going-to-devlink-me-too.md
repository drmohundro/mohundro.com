Last year, [I attended DevLink](http://www.mohundro.com/blog/2007/10/17/devLink2007Recap.aspx). It was very well done and so, this year, I’m going again! 
This time, though, I’m bringing a full contingent from the Northwest Arkansas region. Well, okay… maybe three people total isn’t a contingent. Certainly not enough to warrant [getting a bus](http://devlink.net/TravelInfo/RidethedevLinkBus/tabid/116/Default.aspx)! However, I am still looking forward to heading to DevLink with [Randy Walker](http://www.mysoftwarestartup.com/) and [Michael Johnson](http://michaelcodes.net/). 
If you’re going, look me up. See you there!
