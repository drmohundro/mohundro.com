<p>Last year, <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/2007/10/17/devLink2007Recap.aspx">I attended DevLink</a>. It was very well done and so, this year, I’m going again!</p> <p>This time, though, I’m bringing a full contingent from the Northwest Arkansas region. Well, okay… maybe three people total isn’t a contingent. Certainly not enough to warrant <a href="http://devlink.net/TravelInfo/RidethedevLinkBus/tabid/116/Default.aspx">getting a bus</a>! However, I am still looking forward to heading to DevLink with <a href="http://www.mysoftwarestartup.com/">Randy Walker</a> and <a href="http://michaelcodes.net/">Michael Johnson</a>.</p> <p>If you’re going, look me up. See you there!</p> <p><a href="http://devlink.net/"><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="105" alt="image" src="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/GoingtoDevLinkMetoo_12A69/image_3.png" width="179" border="0"></a></p>
