It definitely still needs some work, but I like the start. The syntax highlighting for opened script files is nice. I'd like to see some intellisense in there, but it isn't a big deal.&nbsp;If intellisense would slow it down much, I think I'd rather not have it anyway.&nbsp;I think the biggest issues I've got with it so far is the lack of options to customize fonts and colors as well as tab expansion.</p> <p>I've haven't had a chance to play with anything else, but it seems nice so far.</p>
