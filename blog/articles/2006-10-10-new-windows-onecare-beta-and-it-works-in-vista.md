I'm a big fan on Windows OneCare. I installed the betas and was thoroughly impressed at it. I recently [posted in frustration](/blog/2006/09/08/windows-one-care-doesnt-work-in-vista-rc1/), though, that the current version wasn't supported in Vista yet. Well, the 1.5 beta has now been released and it is supported under Vista. Here's a screenshot of it on my machine:

So far so good!
