I'm a big fan on Windows OneCare. I installed the betas and was thoroughly impressed at it. I recently [posted in frustration](http://www.mohundro.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,657ca226-0a81-431c-b17d-e79f69be439e.aspx), though, that the current version wasn't supported in Vista yet. Well, the 1.5 beta has now been released and it is supported under Vista. Here's a screenshot of it on my machine:

So far so good!
