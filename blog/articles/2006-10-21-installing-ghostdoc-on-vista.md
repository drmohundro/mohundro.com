I recently installed [GhostDoc 1.9.5](http://www.roland-weigelt.de/ghostdoc/) on Vista RC2 at home. At first, I received as error towards the end of installation so I searched around a little bit to see if anyone else had seen the error. Then, as with most issues I've had with Vista, I decided to see if elevating the install to admin would work which seems to have worked fine. 

The easiest way I've found to run things that don't offer a "Run as admin" option on the click menu (like MSI files) is to run the Command Prompt as an admin and then start the program from there. You can pull up the start menu, type cmd and then CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER which will run the command as an admin ([thanks to Kristan Kenney for that info](http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/kmkenney/archive/2006/10/05/An-easier-way-to-run-elevated.aspx)). Quite a nifty shortcut key for running as an administrator.
