<p>I'm a big fan on Windows OneCare. I installed the betas and was thoroughly impressed at it. I recently <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,657ca226-0a81-431c-b17d-e79f69be439e.aspx">posted in frustration</a>, though, that the current version wasn't supported in Vista yet. Well, the 1.5 beta has now been released and it is supported under Vista. Here's a screenshot of it on my machine:</p> <p><a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/NewWindowsOneCareBetaAnditworksinVista_13300/2006-10-09-onecare%5B3%5D.png" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="576" src="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/NewWindowsOneCareBetaAnditworksinVista_13300/2006-10-09-onecare_thumb%5B1%5D.png" width="790" border="0"></a> </p> <p>So far so good!</p>
