title: "What in the world is Event Validation???"

I remember the first time I ran into an ASP.NET error talking about event validation (specifically while playing with CommunityServer). The solution I discovered at the time was to just disable event validation by setting enableEventValidation to false in the web.config file.<br /><br />Well, thanks to a couple of posts from <a href="http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/default.aspx">K. Scott Allen</a>, I now have a much better understanding of event validation and why it is a really good thing. Check out his posts <a href="http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/archive/2006/03/20/3145.aspx">here</a> and <a href="http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/archive/2006/03/21/3153.aspx">here</a>.<br /><br />Thanks Scott!<br />
