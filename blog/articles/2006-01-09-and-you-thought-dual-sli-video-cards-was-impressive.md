How about **FOUR**?!?

Dell just announced at CES 2006 their XPS Renegade gaming system that utilizes FOUR GPUs with a 4.26 GHz processor. Here is the [link](http://gear.ign.com/articles/679/679405p1.html) at IGN and [here](http://www.dell.com/html/us/products/ces/index.htm) is the direct link to Dell's Flash site.

That's just insane.

And for just over $2,000, you can [purchase](http://www1.us.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/monitor_3007wfp?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs) their 30-inch monitor, too.

Can we say overkill?
