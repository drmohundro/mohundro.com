I decided to download the [Visual Studio 2010 and .NET Framework 4.0 CTP](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=922B4655-93D0-4476-BDA4-94CF5F8D4814&displaylang=en) tonight. It comes packaged in a virtual machine (not sure if it is Vista or what yet... I'm going to bed before running it). 

And... it is big. Really big. 

Pictures are worth a thousand words... in this case, they're worth just over 30 GB.

Wow.
