Last night kicked out the Fort Smith .NET User Group's first meeting. It went great! I would guess that we had at least 20 or 30 people show up. 
[Raymond Lewallen](http://www.raymondlewallen.com/) spoke to us about Behavior Driven Design (BDD). I thought I'd share links to a few of the resources that he brought up last night. <ul>
<li>[Dan North](http://dannorth.net/) - He came up with the BDD idea  <ul><li>[Also check out this blog post for more detail regarding BDD](http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd)</li></ul>
</li>
<li>[specunit-net](http://code.google.com/p/specunit-net/) - A set of extensions to strive for more behavioral tests (specifications) based on [SpecUnit for Ruby](http://spec-unit.rubyforge.org/)  </li>
<li>[NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/) - The testing framework Raymond used  <ul><li>[MbUnit](http://www.mbunit.com/) - I actually use MbUnit for most of my tests, but NUnit is fine.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>[Castle Windsor - The <acronym title="Inversion of Control">IoC</acronym>](http://www.castleproject.org/container/index.html) container that Raymond mentioned. </li> <ul>
<li>Here are a few other <acronym title="Inversion of Control">IoC</acronym>/<acronym title="Dependency Injection">DI</acronym> containers available for .NET development </li> <ul>
<li>[StructureMap](http://structuremap.sourceforge.net/Default.htm) - From [Jeremy Miller](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/)  </li>
<li>[Unity](http://www.codeplex.com/unity) - The Microsoft offering</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>[Rhino.Mocks](http://www.ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks/downloads.aspx) - A mocking framework by [Oren Eini](http://www.ayende.com/Blog/Default.aspx). </li>
<li>[Automocking Container](http://blog.eleutian.com/2007/02/23/TestsAutoMockingIoCContainer.aspx) - An IoC container that takes advantage of Rhino.Mocks for mocking out dependencies. </li>
<li>General BDD resources  <ul>
<li>[Behavior-Driven.org](http://behaviour-driven.org/)  </li>
<li>[The Wikipedia entry on BDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_driven_development)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

All in all, a great presentation. Considering the breadth of information that BDD covers, I think Raymond did a great job. I hope that FSDNUG can continue to bring topics like this to the area.
