<p>I recently moved my RSS reading habits over to Google Reader, primarily because I read feeds at work and home both and I'd rather not have to keep my feeds synchronized in both places. The new design is a million times better than the old design, too.</p> <p>Anyway, a feature that Google Reader provides is a location to view "Shared" items. I've started sharing items that I find interesting from my daily feed reading. So far, it is mainly some cool Engadget posts and some deals, but if anyone is interested, you can view <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/02498816103732107023">my Google Reader Shared items here</a>.</p> <p>So now, you can see my blogroll (at the right side of the screen), <a href="http://del.icio.us/drmohundro">my bookmarks</a> (thank you <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>!), and <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/02498816103732107023">feed items I find interesting</a>.</p> <p>Just wait untill I post a public calendar! Hah!</p>
