title: "Links, Bookmarks, and Sharing Oh My!"

I recently moved my RSS reading habits over to Google Reader, primarily because I read feeds at work and home both and I'd rather not have to keep my feeds synchronized in both places. The new design is a million times better than the old design, too. 
Anyway, a feature that Google Reader provides is a location to view "Shared" items. I've started sharing items that I find interesting from my daily feed reading. So far, it is mainly some cool Engadget posts and some deals, but if anyone is interested, you can view [my Google Reader Shared items here](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/02498816103732107023). 
So now, you can see my blogroll (at the right side of the screen), [my bookmarks](http://del.icio.us/drmohundro) (thank you [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/)!), and [feed items I find interesting](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/02498816103732107023). 
Just wait untill I post a public calendar! Hah!
