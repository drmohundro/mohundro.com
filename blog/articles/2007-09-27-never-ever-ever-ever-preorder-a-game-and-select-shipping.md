I am a moron. 

Like so many of the millions of other Halo fans, I preordered my copy of Halo 3 literally months ago. I've been waiting impatiently for months (years?) for it to release and now it is out. 

And I haven't got to play it yet. 

Because it still hasn't shipped to my door. 

I should have chosen in-store pickup. 

\*sigh\*
