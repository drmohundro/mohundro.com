<p>Tonight, the <a href="http://www.fsdnug.org">FSDNUG</a> group participated in their first launch event ever – for SQL Server 2008! Woo!</p> <p>The gist of it was that 4 of us took about 15 to 20 minutes to talk about different portions of SQL Server. It turned out to be more intro than deep dives, but I think the group got more out of the presentation this way.</p> <p>My portion of the presentation was on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms131089.aspx">SQL CLR</a>.</p> <p>I think my talk went alright, but my demo definitely didn’t work. I blamed the Windows 7 beta but it probably had more to do with my lack of knowledge. *shrug* If you’re interested in trying the example out for yourself, <a href="http://dotnetslackers.com/Community/blogs/basharkokash/archive/2008/06/04/sql-clr-overview.aspx">Bashar Kokash has a good post on it</a>. The example worked fine on my machine without any problems the first time, but during the talk, the Visual Studio deployment apparently didn’t work. Oh well.</p> <p>The other code examples that I had all are linked off of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms131089.aspx">the MSDN overview of SQL CLR link</a> from above, so knock yourself out. <a href="http://www.keithelder.net/blog/archive/2007/10/29/Creating-Custom-SQL-CLR-UserDefined-Types.aspx">Keith Elder’s post on creating custom SQL CLR user-defined types</a> is also a good start.</p> <p>The final two links I used were <a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/resources/Whitepapers/SQL%20Server%20DBA%20Guide%20to%20SQLCLR.htm">this one from SQL Skills</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=sqlclr">this one… that provided most of my information</a> :-) Thanks Google!</p> <p>I enjoyed the chance to present again! If you have any feedback, feel free to let me know.</p>
