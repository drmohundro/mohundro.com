<p></p> <p>After a short hiatus, I’m back with yet another day review of Tech Ed. Just one more after this!</p> <p>The first session I attended on Day 3 was with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/lukeh/">Luke Hoban</a> and <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/">Ted Neward</a> and was entitled “the Busy Developer’s Guide to F#.” If you haven’t heard about <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/fsharp.aspx">F#</a>, it is a product of <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Research</a> that “[combines] the efficiency, scripting, strong typing and productivity of ML with the stability, libraries, cross-language working and tools of .NET.” If that didn’t make sense, the gist of it is that F# is a functional language built on top of .NET. Look at the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/starting.aspx">Getting started with F# page</a> for details. The really interesting thing about F# is that the plan is that it will actually <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/10/17/f-a-functional-programming-language.aspx">graduate from Microsoft Research and become a full blown product from Microsoft</a>. The session itself was great – Luke did the demos while Ted did the talking basically. I’d really like to look into this more. I’ve got the latest version installed, but I haven’t written anything substantial yet.</p> <p>The next session was with <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/default.aspx">Jeffrey Palermo</a> and was entitled “Architectural Concerns for ORM.” While the session was on ORM, what I really got out of it was effective communication of topics like separation of concerns and true decoupling of architecture. I’ve understood the concepts, but I am very ineffective at communicating those concerns to my coworkers. Jeffrey did an excellent job of communicating this and I appreciated that.</p> <p>One of the most random things that occurred while at Tech Ed was at lunch on day 3. I sat down for lunch and a few guys sat down at the table. Every one of them had Sun badges on. Yes, <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</a>, the guys who make <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a>. I was curious, so I asked what was going on. :-) They were there basically to see what Microsoft was up to. Makes sense I guess. I personally hadn’t coded Java since college, but it was still really interesting to talk to them. We all geeked out on Java, dynamic languages (like <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/">JRuby</a> and <a href="http://www.ironruby.net/">IronRuby</a>), mainframes, and horror stories about hardware (like when the sewage backed up into our computer room).</p> <p>After lunch, I attended a session from <a href="http://jamesnewkirk.typepad.com/">James Newkirk</a> on Unit Testing. If I were to summarize the session in a sentence, I’d call it “Reasons Why I Wrote <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/xunit/">xUnit</a>.” James’ story is interesting because he is also one of the original authors of <a href="http://www.nunit.org/">nUnit</a>, which was heavily influenced by <a href="http://www.junit.org/">jUnit</a>. After James left the nUnit, he decided that current thinking on testing frameworks was a little off and <a href="http://jamesnewkirk.typepad.com/posts/2007/09/announcing-xuni.html">he and Brad Wilson created xUnit</a>. The session was very interesting and, as a result, I’m now trying out xUnit on one of my current projects. Easily my favorite thing about xUnit is the change from the [Test] attribute to [Fact] attribute. Unit Testing, or more accurately <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a>, is not really about testing, but creating specifications and design (see <a href="http://behaviour-driven.org/">Behavior Driven Development</a> which is also an attempt to drive this point home).</p> <p>After the session, I went up to ask James some questions, but he needed to head down to an “Ask The Experts” session he was giving on TDD. I ended up walking down with him and <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/">Peter Provost</a> and talked to them about testing, TDD, design, etc. for a good hour. It was really informative and I got some great advice.</p>
