title: "Tech Ed &ndash; Day 3 Review"

After a short hiatus, I’m back with yet another day review of Tech Ed. Just one more after this! 

The first session I attended on Day 3 was with [Luke Hoban](http://blogs.msdn.com/lukeh/) and [Ted Neward](http://blogs.tedneward.com/) and was entitled “the Busy Developer’s Guide to F#.” If you haven’t heard about [F#](http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/fsharp.aspx), it is a product of [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/) that “[combines] the efficiency, scripting, strong typing and productivity of ML with the stability, libraries, cross-language working and tools of .NET.” If that didn’t make sense, the gist of it is that F# is a functional language built on top of .NET. Look at the [Getting started with F# page](http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/starting.aspx) for details. The really interesting thing about F# is that the plan is that it will actually [graduate from Microsoft Research and become a full blown product from Microsoft](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/10/17/f-a-functional-programming-language.aspx). The session itself was great – Luke did the demos while Ted did the talking basically. I’d really like to look into this more. I’ve got the latest version installed, but I haven’t written anything substantial yet. 

The next session was with [Jeffrey Palermo](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/default.aspx) and was entitled “Architectural Concerns for ORM.” While the session was on ORM, what I really got out of it was effective communication of topics like separation of concerns and true decoupling of architecture. I’ve understood the concepts, but I am very ineffective at communicating those concerns to my coworkers. Jeffrey did an excellent job of communicating this and I appreciated that. 

One of the most random things that occurred while at Tech Ed was at lunch on day 3. I sat down for lunch and a few guys sat down at the table. Every one of them had Sun badges on. Yes, [Sun Microsystems](http://www.sun.com/), the guys who make [Java](http://java.sun.com/). I was curious, so I asked what was going on. :-) They were there basically to see what Microsoft was up to. Makes sense I guess. I personally hadn’t coded Java since college, but it was still really interesting to talk to them. We all geeked out on Java, dynamic languages (like [JRuby](http://jruby.codehaus.org/) and [IronRuby](http://www.ironruby.net/)), mainframes, and horror stories about hardware (like when the sewage backed up into our computer room). 

After lunch, I attended a session from [James Newkirk](http://jamesnewkirk.typepad.com/) on Unit Testing. If I were to summarize the session in a sentence, I’d call it “Reasons Why I Wrote [xUnit](http://www.codeplex.com/xunit/).” James’ story is interesting because he is also one of the original authors of [nUnit](http://www.nunit.org/), which was heavily influenced by [jUnit](http://www.junit.org/). After James left the nUnit, he decided that current thinking on testing frameworks was a little off and [he and Brad Wilson created xUnit](http://jamesnewkirk.typepad.com/posts/2007/09/announcing-xuni.html). The session was very interesting and, as a result, I’m now trying out xUnit on one of my current projects. Easily my favorite thing about xUnit is the change from the [Test] attribute to [Fact] attribute. Unit Testing, or more accurately [Test Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), is not really about testing, but creating specifications and design (see [Behavior Driven Development](http://behaviour-driven.org/) which is also an attempt to drive this point home). 

After the session, I went up to ask James some questions, but he needed to head down to an “Ask The Experts” session he was giving on TDD. I ended up walking down with him and [Peter Provost](http://www.peterprovost.org/) and talked to them about testing, TDD, design, etc. for a good hour. It was really informative and I got some great advice.
