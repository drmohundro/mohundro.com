<P>5+&nbsp;crashes in a row is a little much.</P>
<P>And I wasn't even in the designer. And yes, I rebooted. It still happened.</P>
<P>I don't know exactly what I did to fix it, though. Let's just say heavy use of the save button and having another instance of devenv up and attached to the other process. Just in case I needed to copy and paste a call stack somewhere. Of course, that's when it began working.</P>
<P>Oh well.</P>
<P><STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: Don't take this the wrong way. I still love VS2005 as an IDE. However, it still has quite a few issues. The most annoying of which is the flickering while in the designer. And no, I never got that one up in the debugger either.</P>
<P><STRONG>UPDATE</STRONG>: For more information on this, see my new post <A href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,a59a8f4f-a64d-431a-95b2-93f924c6a48a.aspx">here</A>.</P>
