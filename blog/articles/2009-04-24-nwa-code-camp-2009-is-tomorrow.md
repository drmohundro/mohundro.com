If you'll be in the northwest Arkansas area tomorrow (April 25), be sure to come out for the [NWA Code Camp](http://codecamp.nwadnug.org/). There will be presentations on everything ranging from LINQ and Silverlight to iPhone development. I'll be presenting my PowerShell talk one more time as well. If I can count at all, it looks like there will be 15 different speakers total. 

I'm looking forward to it!
