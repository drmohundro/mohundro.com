I picked up a new computer as a Christmas present to myself last yearâ€¦ hadn't gotten around to seeing what the stats were for it until recently, though.

Not too shabby at all if I say so myself. It would be amazing with an SSD in there, but I did upgrade from a approximately 160 GB of storage to a terabyte so I'm not complaining. I particularly enjoy seeing a lot of graphs in task manager, too.

This thing is awesome.
