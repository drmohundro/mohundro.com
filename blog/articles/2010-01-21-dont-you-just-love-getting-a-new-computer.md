<p>I picked up a new computer as a Christmas present to myself last year… hadn’t gotten around to seeing what the stats were for it until recently, though.</p> <p><a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/Dontyoujustlovegettinganewcomputer_13350/image_2.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/Dontyoujustlovegettinganewcomputer_13350/image_thumb.png" width="681" height="363"></a> </p> <p>Not too shabby at all if I say so myself. It would be amazing with an SSD in there, but I did upgrade from a approximately 160 GB of storage to a terabyte so I’m not complaining. I particularly enjoy seeing a lot of graphs in task manager, too.</p> <p><a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/Dontyoujustlovegettinganewcomputer_13350/image_4.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/Dontyoujustlovegettinganewcomputer_13350/image_thumb_1.png" width="888" height="594"></a> </p> <p></p> <p>This thing is awesome.</p>
