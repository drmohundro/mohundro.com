Thanks to [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) for the [heads up](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ConsolasFontFamilyNowAvailableForDownload.aspx).

I've been using Consolas for a few months now and it is easily one of the best programming fonts I've ever used... and I've tried an awful lot of them... (see [here](http://www.lowing.org/fonts/) and [here](http://www.proggyfonts.com/) for others).

Once it is loaded, start [pimping your IDE](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000417.html).
