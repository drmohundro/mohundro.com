Thanks to <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman</a> for the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ConsolasFontFamilyNowAvailableForDownload.aspx">heads up</a>.<br /><br />I've been using Consolas for a few months now and it is easily one of the best programming fonts I've ever used... and I've tried an awful lot of them... (see <a href="http://www.lowing.org/fonts/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.proggyfonts.com/">here</a> for others).<br /><br />Once it is loaded, start <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000417.html">pimping your IDE</a>.<br />
