Most of you probably are already aware of this little development, but there is a [freeware IDE](http://powershell.com/) for PowerShell development ([Scott beat me to the post](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/FreePowerShellIDE.aspx)...). It really is great. One of the most interesting parts about it, at least at first glance, is that it gives a first look at what an IDE might look like if it were to use Office 2007's ribbon. Not only that, but it even has an Mac OS X styled (or [ObjectDock](http://www.objectdock.com/) if you're so inclined) tool section in the bottom right.

Sweet!
