title: "Say what is not an object?!?"

Ahhh, JavaScript error messages. 
&lt;sarcasm&gt;<br>They are the epitome of the user friendly error message. Developers love them, because they always tell you exactly where the problem is. Absolute error message perfection.<br>&lt;/sarcasm&gt; 
Below is an example of one of these messages that a friend sent: 
[<img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="101" src="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/Saywhatisnotanobject_9AEE/crazy-javascript-error_thumb.png" width="712" border="0">](http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/Saywhatisnotanobject_9AEE/crazy-javascript-error%5B2%5D.png)  
Nice, eh? 
You can tell EXACTLY what the problem is. That... thing... is null or not an object! And we've even got a line number, too! 
<strong>NOTE:</strong> The above message was generated by a script I wrote a while back that is kicked off by the window.onerror event that fires when JavaScript exceptions are thrown. It posts to an application which then emails the developers in question.
