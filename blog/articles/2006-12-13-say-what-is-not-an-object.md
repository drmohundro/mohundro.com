Ahhh, JavaScript error messages. 

&lt;sarcasm&gt;

They are the epitome of the user friendly error message. Developers love them, because they always tell you exactly where the problem is. Absolute error message perfection.

&lt;/sarcasm&gt; 

Below is an example of one of these messages that a friend sent: 

![Crazy JavaScript Error](http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/Saywhatisnotanobject_9AEE/crazy-javascript-error%5B2%5D.png)

Nice, eh? 

You can tell EXACTLY what the problem is. That... thing... is null or not an object! And we've even got a line number, too! 

**NOTE:** The above message was generated by a script I wrote a while back that is kicked off by the window.onerror event that fires when JavaScript exceptions are thrown. It posts to an application which then emails the developers in question.
