If you live anywhere around Memphis, be sure to be there on November 10. That is when the [Memphis Day of .NET is scheduled](http://dayofdotnet.mnug.net/). It was just [announced today that Charles Petzold will be delivering the keynote](http://dayofdotnet.mnug.net/post/Keynote-Speaker-Announced-Charles-Petzold.aspx) as well! [Charles has already posted about it on his blog](http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2007/10/311018.html). I'm incredibly jealous of all of you who are planning on being there - I had been planning to go but then when I found out when it was scheduled, I realized I had conflicts and wouldn't be able to make it. Of the other speakers scheduled, I got the chance to meet both [Keith Elder](http://keithelder.net/blog/) and [Jeff Blankenburg](http://www.jeffblankenburg.com/index.html) at [DevLink](http://devlink.net/) and I know their presentations will be great. I know that [Colin](http://www.colinneller.com/blog/) and others have put a lot of hard work into making the Day of .NET great, so if you get the chance, go out there and show them your support!
