Check out [this article](http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=1832946) on ABC News. Or this [press release](http://www.winternals.com/Company/PressRelease77.aspx) from Winternals.

Apparently, a few members of Geek Squad have been using pirated versions of software from [Winternals](http://www.winternals.com/). In case you're unfamiliar with Winternals, they're the enterprise side of [Sysinternals](http://www.sysinternals.com/), which provides the excellent [Process Explorer](http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/ProcessExplorer.html) as well as a few other invaluable tools. Mark Russinovich, who [discovered](http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html) the original Sony DRM rootkit, is one of the people who established the company. 

Way to go Best Buy.
