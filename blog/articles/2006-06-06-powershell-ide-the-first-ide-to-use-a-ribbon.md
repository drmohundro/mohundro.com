title: "PowerShell IDE (the first IDE to use a ribbon?)"

Most of you probably are already aware of this little development, but there is a <a href="http://powershell.com/">freeware IDE</a> for PowerShell development (<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/FreePowerShellIDE.aspx">Scott beat me to the post</a>...). It really is great. One of the most interesting parts about it, at least at first glance, is that it gives a first look at what an IDE might look like if it were to use Office 2007's ribbon. Not only that, but it even has an Mac OS X styled (or <a href="http://www.objectdock.com/">ObjectDock</a> if you're so inclined) tool section in the bottom right.<br /><br />Sweet!<br />
