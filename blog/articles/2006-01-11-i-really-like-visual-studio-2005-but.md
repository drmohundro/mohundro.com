5+ crashes in a row is a little much.

And I wasn't even in the designer. And yes, I rebooted. It still happened.

I don't know exactly what I did to fix it, though. Let's just say heavy use of the save button and having another instance of devenv up and attached to the other process. Just in case I needed to copy and paste a call stack somewhere. Of course, that's when it began working.

Oh well.

**NOTE**: Don't take this the wrong way. I still love VS2005 as an IDE. However, it still has quite a few issues. The most annoying of which is the flickering while in the designer. And no, I never got that one up in the debugger either.

**UPDATE**: For more information on this, see my new post [here](http://www.mohundro.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,a59a8f4f-a64d-431a-95b2-93f924c6a48a.aspx).
