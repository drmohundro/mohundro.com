If you've never seen some of the posts from [Kevin Moore](http://blogs.msdn.com/okoboji/) regarding WPF ([commonly pronounced Avalon](http://www.simplegeek.com/PermaLink.aspx/848ef1d4-f694-43ee-92f7-047478b6b894)), you should definitely check them out. In particular, some of the things you can do with [ListViews and XAML](http://blogs.msdn.com/okoboji/archive/2006/02/23/538340.aspx) are incredible! He points to [this post](http://blogs.msdn.com/atc_avalon_team/archive/2006/02/23/537715.aspx) to show some of the XAML that is required and, really, it doesn't look that bad. To get something like that out of the built-in ListView in .NET 1.1 or .NET 2.0, you would have to do some owner-drawn madness... or do the entire thing yourself.

I don't know about you, but I'm looking forward to WPF!
