title: "NHibernate Unit Testing… with Fluent NHibernate!"

<p>I’ve been attempting to learn NHibernate lately. One of the big draws for me was the ability to write unit tests that did hit a database, but an in-memory one. Ayende recently posted on <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2009/04/28/nhibernate-unit-testing.aspx">how to use SQLite to get in-memory unit tests</a>. His example assumed standard hbm mappings and configuration.</p> <p>I was curious how hard it would be port his example over to Fluent NHibernate. Not surprisingly, it was quite easy actually!</p> <p>Here’s the Blog entity I used, which is based on the usage I saw from Ayende’s post:</p> <p><script src="http://gist.github.com/114239.js"></script></p> <p>And here is the mapping:</p> <p><script src="http://gist.github.com/114241.js"></script></p> <p>As you can see, it is pretty straight forward so far. The next piece of code is the Fluent NHibernate implementation of Ayende’s InMemoryDatabaseTest.</p> <p><script src="http://gist.github.com/114242.js"></script></p> <p>There aren’t too many differences really. We’re using the same SchemaExport, but we do need to call ExposeConfiguration so that we can store off a reference to the Configuration to be used by the SchemaExport instance.</p> <p>The final piece, the actual test itself, is identical to Ayende’s example, except that I’m using MbUnit instead of xUnit:</p> <p><script src="http://gist.github.com/114244.js"></script></p> <p>Nice and easy! I like it!</p> <p>As you can also tell, I’m experimenting with using <a href="http://github.com/">github</a>’s <a href="http://gist.github.com/">gist</a> feature. I’ve been using <a href="http://github.com/">github</a> to store off my dot files and other environment-related settings as well as my presentations, but the gist feature seems pretty nice.</p>
