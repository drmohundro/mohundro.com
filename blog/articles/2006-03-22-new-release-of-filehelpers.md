I've [blogged about FileHelpers](/blog/2006/01/05/the-filehelpers-library-rocks/) before. I like it a lot.

Since then, Marcos has added even more great features to it including support for .NET 2.0 Generics and a new Wizard application that really increases the speed in developing new records.

Marcos has an [article](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/filehelpers.asp) up on [CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/) as well as a FileHelpers [website](http://filehelpers.sourceforge.net/) with examples and a support forum.

Seriously, if you're still using String.Substring calls to parse out flat files, give the library a try.
