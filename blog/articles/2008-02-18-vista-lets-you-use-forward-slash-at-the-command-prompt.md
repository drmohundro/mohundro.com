title: "Vista lets you use forward slash at the command prompt!"

<p>I was just setting at a command prompt in Vista on my laptop and I typed 'cd /' out of habit and, to my surprise, it worked! Not only that, but tab completion still behaved as expected!</p> <p>I actually have been using the '/' character in PowerShell because it is easier to type than '\' (not as far to reach) and it is the default in *NIX systems as well (i.e. my Ubuntu installation).</p> <p>Now granted, I probably shouldn't get used to this in the event that I inadvertently code a '/' character in one of my programs, but then again, I should technically be using the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.path.pathseparator.aspx">System.IO.Path.PathSeparator</a> anyway.</p> <p>I get excited about the little things.</p> <p>NOTE - this might be the result of Service Pack 1 on Vista also...</p> <p><strong>UPDATE</strong> - I lied. You can type 'cd /' and get to the root, but tab completion still completes only for the current directory. In other words, if you're current directory is c:\windows\ and you type 'cd /[tab]', you'll get directories that are in c:\windows. Sorry. My excitement just dropped a little.</p>
