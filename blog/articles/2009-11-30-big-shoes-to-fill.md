Almost 2 years ago a few guys in the Fort Smith area [decided we needed a .NET User Group here](http://www.mohundro.com/blog/2008/02/11/MyFirstNETUserGroupMeetingAndFSDNUG.aspx). We've fairly consistently had a good 20 to 30 people show up to every meeting since then. [Michael Paladino](http://www.mpaladino.com/) has done a great job serving as FSDNUG's president since that time... but [earlier this year he moved up to the Northwest Arkansas area](http://www.mpaladino.com/post/A-New-Adventure.aspx). As you might imagine, it's pretty tough to be the user group president when the group you're presiding over meets a good 45+ minute drive away. Well, he finally stepped down this month which means someone else has to take the reins.

For good or bad, I'm his replacement :-) 

I just wanted to publicly thank Michael for the hard work he's put into [FSDNUG](http://fsdnug.org). I'm still pretty intimidated by the responsibility, but I'm also looking forward to it.

If you haven't attended a meeting yet, stop by some time. The meetings serve as an excellent way to supplement the training and knowledge that we as developers have to have in order to stay afloat. 

If you're already attending the meetings but you've got some suggestions on ways we can improve, let me know. 

Thanks to all the members - I'm looking forward to starting the meetings back up in January!
