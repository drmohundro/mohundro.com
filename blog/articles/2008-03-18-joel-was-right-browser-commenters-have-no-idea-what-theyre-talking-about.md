<p>If you haven't already read <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel</a>'s <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/03/17.html">commentary on the current situation with browsers</a>, specifically the Internet Explorer 8 beta, you should check it out<sup>1</sup>. As always, read the <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/03/18/translation-from-ms-speak-to-english-of-selected-portions-of-joel-spolskys-martin-headsets">opposing viewpoint</a> as well. I would say that some of the comments to that post might provide more value than the sarcasm in the post, specifically <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/03/18/translation-from-ms-speak-to-english-of-selected-portions-of-joel-spolskys-martin-headsets#comment-11535">this comment</a> from Mark himself.</p> <p>But you know, I'm not really posting to talk about the problems with browser compliance, web standards, or anything like that. I'm talking more about how commenters really have no clue what they're talking about. From Joel's post, "99% of the participants in the flame wars are not going to understand what theyâ€™re talking about."</p> <p>The most recent post on the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/">IEBlog</a> revolved around how the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/03/18/webbrowser-control-rendering-modes-in-ie8.aspx">WebBrowser control will render sites</a>. One of the first comments is a complaint about naming regarding the WebBrowser control. The thing is, that <em>is</em> what it is named! Just try a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=webbrowser%20control">Google search on the topic</a>!</p> <p>I guess this is exactly what Joel was talking about when he questioned the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/07/20.html">value of comments on sites that have enough traffic</a>. Good thing my site doesn't get that much traffic :-) Comments to my posts (when they come) are still quite welcome!</p> <p><sup>1</sup> While you're there, read the rest of his posts.
