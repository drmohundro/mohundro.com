<p>I am a moron.</p> <p>Like so many of the millions of other Halo fans, I preordered my copy of Halo 3 literally months ago. I've been waiting impatiently for months (years?) for it to release and now it is out.</p> <p>And I haven't got to play it yet.</p> <p>Because it still hasn't shipped to my door.</p> <p>I should have chosen in-store pickup.</p> <p>*sigh*</p>
