I was catching up on some older blog posts from different people recently and I came across [some](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SlickRunAndQuickSilver.aspx) [posts](http://www.shahine.com/omar/NewSlickRunBeta.aspx) talking about how wonderful [SlickRun](http://www.bayden.com/SlickRun/) is. Everyone is right, by the way, because SlickRun is amazing. It was probably the main program that moved me from being primarily a mouse user to a keyboard user. I still love how fast I can get around by taking my hand off the mouse and keeping them on the keyboard! 

Anyway, I'm a [beta junkie](http://www.mohundro.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,d8543c4e-d0ab-44ba-9f7e-a5244a764d63.aspx) and I love finding out about new releases of software. I'd been looking for news on SlickRun for a while, but hadn't seen anything so I thought I would check out the [SlickRun forums](http://groups.msn.com/bayden/slickrun.msnw). I ended up finding [this post](http://groups.msn.com/bayden/slickrun.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=3&LastModified=4675589231129791388) where Eric notes that, because he is actually *working* on Windows Vista, the alphas for SlickRun probably won't show up until after the RTM for Vista. 

Though I don't think a forum post carries nearly as much weight as a blog post on release announcements, I still have to say that I can't wait to see what Eric is working on for the new version. I'm looking forward to more from SlickRun!
