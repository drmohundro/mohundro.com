For your enjoyment, here is some great dialogue from the movie [Airplane](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080339/). Why am I providing this? Because it is funny and because I wanted to. 

> **Roger Murdock:** We have clearance, Clarence.

> **Capt. Clarence Oveur:** Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?

> **Tower:** Tower Radio, clearance, over.

> **Oveur:** That's 'Clarence Oveur', over.

> **Tower:** Roger.

> **Roger Murdock:** Huh?

> **Tower:** Roger, over.

> **Roger Murdock:** What?

> **Capt. Oveur:** Huh?

Many thanks to Kaelin for providing this.
