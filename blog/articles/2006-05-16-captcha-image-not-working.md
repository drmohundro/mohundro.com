Marcos, thanks for the heads up on the captcha image not working...

I just tried the comment link myself and it failed. I copied the source for the image it was trying to load and the page I got gave me an error about XML parsing - "no element found". Anyone else having any problems with dasBlog and the captcha image not working?

Am I running an older version? Has there been an update?

I finally got the captcha image up, but it would appear it was more because of my persistence than actually changing anything (aka I kept clicking comments... [something about definition of insanity](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/alberteins133991.html)...).
