<p>This post has absolutely nothing to do with anything. Just some ramblings from my brain this morning.</p> <p>I got to work a few minutes ago and the first thing I do every morning is go pour myself a cup of coffee. The coffee doesn't bother me too much - at least after I pour some sugar and cream in it and it looks more like milk than coffee. However, others at work despise the stuff. It's the typical coffee you might find at any other corporate office... except maybe Starbucks.</p> <p>That's when the ironic thought hit me.</p> <p>What if the coffee that Starbucks has for their employees is the same coffee sludge that every other corporate office has? Wouldn't that be hilarious? Wouldn't it be... <em>ironic</em>?</p> <p>It must be too early in the morning to form coherent thoughts.</p>
