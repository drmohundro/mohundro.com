title: "Lessons in Security!  (with sarcasm!)"

One of my co-workers was recently chided for emailing a password to access an internal server recently. "Don't email passwords! Email isn't secure!" I don't know if those were the exact words, but you get the point. Don't send around secure data by insecure means, right?<br /><br />Later, this same co-worker of mine was handed a sticky note with a server name, userid, and password with which to access a different internal server. This note was from the same group who has been preaching on not sending secure data by insecure means like email.<br /><br />Let that sink in for a second.<br /><br />I just have a simple question... what makes a sticky note stuck on a monitor any more secure than sending an email? Just curious...<br />
