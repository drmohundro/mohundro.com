<p>I was reading through my feeds this morning and came across this gem of a paragraph:</p> <blockquote> <p>Manual testing is immoral. Not only is it high stress, tedious, and error prone; itâ€™s just wrong to turn humans into machines. If you can write a script for a test procedure, then you can write a program to execute that procedure. That program will be cheaper, faster, and more accurate than a human, and will free the human to do what humans to best: <em>create!</em></p></blockquote> <p>The paragraph is actually an aside to the rest of the post, too!
