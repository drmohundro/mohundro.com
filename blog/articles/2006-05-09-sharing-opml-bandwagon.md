Well, I jumped on the <a href="http://share.opml.org/">Share Your OPML</a> bandwagon today...<br /><br /><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ShareMyOPMLEveryonesDoingIt.aspx">Scott</a> is right, too - one of the most interesting aspects of the website is the Subscriptions Like Mine section.<br /><br />Is it a surprise to anyone that the subscription most like mine is <a href="http://www.colinneller.com/blog/">Colin</a>'s? (or is mine most like his???) Also, I have to say, I can't believe that some people out there have almost 3000 feeds they subscribe to (see <a href="http://share.opml.org/prolificsubscribers/">Most Prolific Subscribers</a>). Can we say information overload?<br />
