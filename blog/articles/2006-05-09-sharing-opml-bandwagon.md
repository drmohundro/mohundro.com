Well, I jumped on the [Share Your OPML](http://share.opml.org/) bandwagon today...

[Scott](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ShareMyOPMLEveryonesDoingIt.aspx) is right, too - one of the most interesting aspects of the website is the Subscriptions Like Mine section.

Is it a surprise to anyone that the subscription most like mine is [Colin](http://www.colinneller.com/blog/)'s? (or is mine most like his???) Also, I have to say, I can't believe that some people out there have almost 3000 feeds they subscribe to (see [Most Prolific Subscribers](http://share.opml.org/prolificsubscribers/)). Can we say information overload?
