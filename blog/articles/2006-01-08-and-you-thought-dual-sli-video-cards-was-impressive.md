<P>How about <STRONG>FOUR</STRONG>?!?</P>
<P>Dell just announced at&nbsp;CES 2006&nbsp;their XPS Renegade gaming system that utilizes FOUR GPUs with a 4.26 GHz processor. Here is the <A href="http://gear.ign.com/articles/679/679405p1.html">link</A> at IGN and <A href="http://www.dell.com/html/us/products/ces/index.htm">here</A> is the direct link to Dell's Flash site.</P>
<P>That's just insane.</P>
<P>And for just over $2,000, you can <A href="http://www1.us.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/monitor_3007wfp?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs">purchase</A> their 30-inch monitor, too.</P>
<P>Can we say overkill?</P>
