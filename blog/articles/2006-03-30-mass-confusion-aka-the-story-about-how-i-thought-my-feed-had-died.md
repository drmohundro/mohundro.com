<P>Yesterday afternoon, I posted on <A href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,2e837c6d-a5b5-4eb1-a679-b375d27b3d06.aspx">ShellExecuteEx and executing files with unknown file extensions</A>. I was really confused, though, because my feed just wouldn't show up in my aggregator (<A href="http://www.rssbandit.org">RSS Bandit</A>). I knew it wasn't my reader, though, because I had navigated to my feed's address (<A href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/DavidMohundro">http://feeds.feedburner.com/DavidMohundro</A>) and it wasn't displaying my added post. I threw a few test posts out there but nothing would show up. I'll admit, I couldn't help but wonder if something had happened with FeedBurner. I shouldn't have doubted, though. It was indirectly my fault.</P>
<P>You see, FeedBurner has a nice report called FeedMedic (located under their Troubleshootize tab). I hadn't found that report until this afternoon. It informed me that my source feed was too large. </P>
<P>Wha??? </P>
<P>Apparently, my last post on file extensions was too big. I ended up editing the last post and taking out a lot of the unnecessary HTML that came out of my code to HTML addin. I ended up using <A href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Jeff Atwood</A>'s great <A href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000429.html">FormatToHtml VS2005 macro</A>. The HTML it generates is a lot simpler, but also a lot cleaner. That solution alone dropped my post under the "large" size. Now everyone can happily see my posts again!</P>
