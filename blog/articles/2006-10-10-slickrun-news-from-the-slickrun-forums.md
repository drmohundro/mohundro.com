<p>I was catching up on some older blog posts from different people recently and I came across <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SlickRunAndQuickSilver.aspx">some</a> <a href="http://www.shahine.com/omar/NewSlickRunBeta.aspx">posts</a> talking about how wonderful <a href="http://www.bayden.com/SlickRun/">SlickRun</a> is. Everyone is right, by the way, because SlickRun is amazing. It was probably the main program that moved me from being primarily a mouse user to a keyboard user. I still love how fast I can get around by taking my hand off the mouse and keeping them on the keyboard!</p> <p>Anyway, I'm a <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,d8543c4e-d0ab-44ba-9f7e-a5244a764d63.aspx">beta junkie</a>&nbsp;and I love finding out about new releases of software. I'd been looking for news on SlickRun for a while, but hadn't seen anything so I thought I would check out the <a href="http://groups.msn.com/bayden/slickrun.msnw">SlickRun forums</a>. I ended up finding <a href="http://groups.msn.com/bayden/slickrun.msnw?action=get_message&amp;mview=0&amp;ID_Message=3&amp;LastModified=4675589231129791388">this post</a> where Eric notes that, because he is actually <em>working</em> on Windows Vista, the alphas for SlickRun probably won't show up until after the RTM for Vista.</p> <p>Though I don't think a forum post carries nearly as much weight as a blog post on release announcements,&nbsp;I still have to say that I can't wait to see what Eric is working on for the new version. I'm looking forward to more from SlickRun!</p>
