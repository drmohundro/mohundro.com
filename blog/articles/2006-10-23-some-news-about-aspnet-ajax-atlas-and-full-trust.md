<p>I guess this is really more&nbsp;of a <em>link</em> regarding ASP.NET AJAX and Full Trust.</p> <p>Ken Cox <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/kencox/archive/2006/10/21/Full-Trust-Strikes-Again.aspx">points out</a> that the new AJAX extensions install themselves into the GAC instead of a Bin subdirectory. I hadn't really thought about this until he notes how this affects those of us (me included) who have shared web hosting. </p> <p>I've been&nbsp;putting a picture slideshow together for my sister's wedding and I've spent the past couple of nights working on a nice, AJAX-y website that would allow her to pick her own captions for the pictures and customize the slides without me having to email a huge PowerPoint file to her. It sounds like I'll have to look at another option for the time being, though, because I doubt I'll be able to convince my web host to install beta software to the GAC.</p> <p>*sigh*</p> <p>What fun it is being a beta junkie.</p>
