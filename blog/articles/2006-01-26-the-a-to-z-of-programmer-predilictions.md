"The A to Z of Programmer Predilictions" is a funny little article that categorizes programmers into various stereotypes, most of which are surprisingly accurate. As I read through the descriptions, I started spotting people in my organization. Though I (and everyone else) can probably fit into a variety of different personas described there, I probably am most like "Zealous Zack." I DO download all of the betas (even at work!) and, when someone blogs about the "Next New Thing," I've got the download started before I've finished reading the post about it.

Speaking of, I need to download the newest WinFX bits...
