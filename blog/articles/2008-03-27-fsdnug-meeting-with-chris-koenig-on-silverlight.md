Just a reminder to anyone in the Fort Smith area - we'll be meeting next Monday night at 6:00 to hear [Chris Koenig](http://blogs.msdn.com/chkoenig/) talk about Silverlight. Chris is a Microsoft Developer Evangelist located out of Dallas. I got to meet Chris last year for a grand total of about 5 minutes when I went down for the .NET Roadshow that was hosted at Microsoft's office in Dallas. Chris got to escort me and the others between floors on the elevator :-) 

Anyway, if you're in the area, swing by. We'd love to see you. For more information, check out the [FSDNUG website](http://fsdnug.org/).
