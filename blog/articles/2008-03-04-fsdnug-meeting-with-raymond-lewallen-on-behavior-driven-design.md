Last night kicked out the Fort Smith .NET User Group's first meeting. It went great! I would guess that we had at least 20 or 30 people show up. 

[Raymond Lewallen](http://www.raymondlewallen.com/) spoke to us about Behavior Driven Design (BDD). I thought I'd share links to a few of the resources that he brought up last night. 

- [Dan North](http://dannorth.net/) - He came up with the BDD idea
  - [Also check out this blog post for more detail regarding BDD](http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd)
- [specunit-net](http://code.google.com/p/specunit-net/) - A set of extensions to strive for more behavioral tests (specifications) based on [SpecUnit for Ruby](http://spec-unit.rubyforge.org/)
- [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/) - The testing framework Raymond used
  - [MbUnit](http://www.mbunit.com/) - I actually use MbUnit for most of my tests, but NUnit is fine.
- [Castle Windsor - The <acronym title="Inversion of Control">IoC</acronym>](http://www.castleproject.org/container/index.html) container that Raymond mentioned.
  - Here are a few other <acronym title="Inversion of Control">IoC</acronym>/<acronym title="Dependency Injection">DI</acronym> containers available for .NET development
    - [StructureMap](http://structuremap.sourceforge.net/Default.htm) - From [Jeremy Miller](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/)
    - [Unity](http://www.codeplex.com/unity) - The Microsoft offering
- [Rhino.Mocks](http://www.ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks/downloads.aspx) - A mocking framework by [Oren Eini](http://www.ayende.com/Blog/Default.aspx).
- [Automocking Container](http://blog.eleutian.com/2007/02/23/TestsAutoMockingIoCContainer.aspx) - An IoC container that takes advantage of Rhino.Mocks for mocking out dependencies.
- General BDD resources
  - [Behavior-Driven.org](http://behaviour-driven.org/)
  - [The Wikipedia entry on BDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_driven_development)

All in all, a great presentation. Considering the breadth of information that BDD covers, I think Raymond did a great job. I hope that FSDNUG can continue to bring topics like this to the area.
