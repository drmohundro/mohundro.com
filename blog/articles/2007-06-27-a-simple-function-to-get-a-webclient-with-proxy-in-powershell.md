title: "A simple function to get a WebClient (with proxy) in PowerShell"

<p>I was browsing around a few days ago and came across a link to a blog post on the SAPIEN website about <a href="http://blog.sapien.com/current/2007/5/7/live-search-in-windows-powershell.html">searching live.com from PowerShell</a>. Sounds cool, I think, so I download it to try it out only to be thwarted by the proxy at work.</p> <p>There are a lot of scripts out there that use the System.Net.WebClient and the vast majority don't take proxies into account. To get around this issue, here's a simple script that I wrote to help out:</p> <p style="font-family: consolas, monospace">function Get-ProxyWebClient {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $webclient = New-Object System.Net.WebClient<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $proxy = New-Object System.Net.WebProxy($global:ProxyUrl, $global:ProxyPort)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $proxy.Credentials = (Get-Credential).GetNetworkCredential()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $webclient.Proxy = $proxy<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return $webclient<br>}  <p>This script makes the assumption that you've already predefined the $global.ProxyUrl and $global.ProxyPort variables in your profile. It is also nice for me because it prompts me for my credentials instead of having them hard-coded in the script or in my profile.</p> <p>Now I can also check the weather from PowerShell using the Show-Weather script that the guys at SAPIEN provided in their <a href="http://blog.sapien.com/current/2007/6/13/one-prompt-to-rule-them-all.html">Ã¼ber-prompt post</a>.</p>
