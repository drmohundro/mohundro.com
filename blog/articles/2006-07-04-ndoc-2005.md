Just a short note, but for those who have been waiting for a version of NDoc that supports .NET 2.0 assemblies, there is a separate project out on SourceForge called <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=163095">NDoc 2005</a>. It is still in beta, but it may be the way to go until NDoc gets moving again. <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/msdn/showpost.aspx?postid=110491&amp;SiteID=1&amp;PageID=1">Per comments at MSDN forums</a>, it looks like the best way to go is to download the source and recompile it yourself. The binaries (at least the GUI binary) looks like it still has some issues.<br /><br /><b>Note:</b> unfortunately, it still doesn't completely work for me... *sigh*<br /><br />(<a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/products/NET_2_0_Documentation_Coming_Next_Week">from DotNetKicks</a>)<br />
