Just a short note, but for those who have been waiting for a version of NDoc that supports .NET 2.0 assemblies, there is a separate project out on SourceForge called [NDoc 2005](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=163095). It is still in beta, but it may be the way to go until NDoc gets moving again. [Per comments at MSDN forums](http://forums.microsoft.com/msdn/showpost.aspx?postid=110491&SiteID=1&PageID=1), it looks like the best way to go is to download the source and recompile it yourself. The binaries (at least the GUI binary) look like they still have some issues.

**Note:** unfortunately, it still doesn't completely work for me... *sigh*
