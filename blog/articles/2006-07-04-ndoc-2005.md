Just a short note, but for those who have been waiting for a version of NDoc that supports .NET 2.0 assemblies, there is a separate project out on SourceForge called [NDoc 2005](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=163095). It is still in beta, but it may be the way to go until NDoc gets moving again. <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/msdn/showpost.aspx?postid=110491&SiteID=1&PageID=1">Per comments at MSDN forums</a>, it looks like the best way to go is to download the source and recompile it yourself. The binaries (at least the GUI binary) looks like it still has some issues.<br><br><b>Note:</b> unfortunately, it still doesn't completely work for me... *sigh*<br><br>([from DotNetKicks](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/products/NET_2_0_Documentation_Coming_Next_Week))<br>
