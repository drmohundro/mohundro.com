I was going through some code today and stumbled across the following: 
[<img title="Mmmmm... that was a good exception" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="61" alt="Mmmmm... that was a good exception" src="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/Bestcommentoftheday_8EDF/image_thumb.png" width="438" border="0">](http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/Bestcommentoftheday_8EDF/image_2.png)  
Hilarious.
