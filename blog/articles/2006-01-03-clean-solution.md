<P>Has anyone noticed a new menu item under the Build menu in Visual Studio 2005? There is a Clean Solution item that will remove all of the compiled binaries that live under your bin folder. It is relatively similar to <A href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000368.html">Clean Sources Plus</A>, except that it keeps the folders.</P>
<P>Note: I'm not sure if it shows up in every VS configuration. I'm using the default view (see&nbsp;Tools -&gt; Import and Export Settings).</P>
