<p>I promised the slides, notes and links from my <a href="http://mnug.net">Memphis .NET User Group</a> talk, so here they are… and wow, they haven’t really changed much from when I gave the <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/2008/09/09/PowerShellFSDNUGPresentationWithSlidesAndNotes.aspx">PowerShell talk</a> to the <a href="http://fsdnug.org">FSDNUG</a> group. So, I’ll just link to the <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/2008-09-08-fsdnug-powershell-presentation.zip">zip of the presentation from that talk</a>.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The primary slide that I added to my presentation was entirely related to a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> question entitled, “<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8722/how-do-you-use-powershell">how do you use PowerShell</a>.”</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I felt that the talk went fairly well, but I did have to rush towards the end because I added an overview of some real scripts that I use, but I didn’t remove enough of my prior content… thus, the rush. :-)&nbsp; No big deal, though. I did get the feeling that there were a few people who didn’t really feel that PowerShell applied to them, but hey, that’s fine. At least there weren’t any tomatoes!</p> <p>I’ll be presenting one more time (as far as I know) this year at <a href="http://www.harding.edu">Harding University</a>. I’m looking forward to it, too. I’ll be presenting for the <a href="http://www.harding.edu/comp/calendar.html">Computing Seminar on October 9</a>. The last time I <a href="http://www.harding.edu/comp/compsem00s.html">spoke before Seminar was in 2003</a> when I talked about “Smart Client Software.” That was when it was for college credit! I’m planning on changing the talk up a little to direct it more towards CS students instead of professional developers. I imagine it will be a slightly different audience than the typical .NET User Group, too. We’ll see.</p> <p>Back on the MNUG talk, thanks to <a href="http://www.mysoftwarestartup.com/">Randy</a> for driving and thanks to <a href="http://www.colinneller.com/blog/">Colin</a> for inviting me to speak. It was fun!</p>
