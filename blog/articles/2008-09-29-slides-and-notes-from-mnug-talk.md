I promised the slides, notes and links from my [Memphis .NET User Group](http://mnug.net) talk, so here they areâ€¦ and wow, they haven't really changed much from when I gave the [PowerShell talk](http://www.mohundro.com/blog/2008/09/09/PowerShellFSDNUGPresentationWithSlidesAndNotes.aspx) to the [FSDNUG](http://fsdnug.org) group. So, I'll just link to the [zip of the presentation from that talk](http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/2008-09-08-fsdnug-powershell-presentation.zip). 
 
The primary slide that I added to my presentation was entirely related to a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) question entitled, "[how do you use PowerShell](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8722/how-do-you-use-powershell)."
 
I felt that the talk went fairly well, but I did have to rush towards the end because I added an overview of some real scripts that I use, but I didn't remove enough of my prior content... thus, the rush. :-)  No big deal, though. I did get the feeling that there were a few people who didn't really feel that PowerShell applied to them, but hey, that's fine. At least there weren't any tomatoes! 

I'll be presenting one more time (as far as I know) this year at [Harding University](http://www.harding.edu). I'm looking forward to it, too. I'll be presenting for the [Computing Seminar on October 9](http://www.harding.edu/comp/calendar.html). The last time I [spoke before Seminar was in 2003](http://www.harding.edu/comp/compsem00s.html) when I talked about "Smart Client Software." That was when it was for college credit! I'm planning on changing the talk up a little to direct it more towards CS students instead of professional developers. I imagine it will be a slightly different audience than the typical .NET User Group, too. We'll see. 

Back on the MNUG talk, thanks to [Randy](http://www.mysoftwarestartup.com/) for driving and thanks to [Colin](http://www.colinneller.com/blog/) for inviting me to speak. It was fun!
