<p></p> <p>I’m continuing my <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/2008/07/01/TechEdPreconferenceOverview.aspx">review of Tech Ed from yesterday</a>. Yes I still realize that I’m a month behind. :-)</p> <p>So, after breakfast, I imagine what everyone will be interested in is the keynote by Bill Gates. Here’s the view I had after sitting down:</p> <p><a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/TechEdDay1Review_8272/Tech%20Ed%202008%202008-06-02%20002.jpg"><img title="Getting ready for Bill Gates' keynote" style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="483" alt="Getting ready for Bill Gates' keynote" src="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/TechEdDay1Review_8272/Tech%20Ed%202008%202008-06-02%20002_thumb.jpg" width="644" border="0"></a> </p> <p>Woohoo! Below is my great picture of Bill Gates, too. I tweaked the image slightly so that you can spot him.</p> <p><a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/TechEdDay1Review_8272/Tech%20Ed%202008%202008-06-02%20004_2.jpg"><img title="Tech Ed 2008 2008-06-02 004" style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="483" alt="Tech Ed 2008 2008-06-02 004" src="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/TechEdDay1Review_8272/Tech%20Ed%202008%202008-06-02%20004_thumb.jpg" width="644" border="0"></a> </p> <p>Anyway, keynote… yeah. Sort of boring. They started off with the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=&amp;=&amp;q=bill%20gates%20retirement%20video">Bill Gates Retirement Video</a>. I think there might have been a little bit more content than the first time it was released, but still, nothing new. There was talk about <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/soa/products/oslo.aspx">Oslo</a>, but I wasn’t really interested. I don’t really want modeling tools to improve architecture, when the drag/drop designer tools are leading me away from good architecture anyway. If you’re interested in any more regarding the keynote, check out <a href="http://herdingcode.com/">Herding Code</a>’s <a href="http://herdingcode.com/?p=15">overview of the keynote announcements</a>.</p> <p></p> <p>The first real session I attended was by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/default.aspx">Grigori Melnik</a> and he covered <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/entlib">Enterprise Library 4</a>. Honestly, my feeling regarding EntLib is <em>way too much XML configuration</em>. I’m also not a fan of the config editor for the configuration. I’d really rather configure it in code or using some <acronym title="Domain Specific Language">DSL</acronym> support or something. I’m interested in <a href="http://codeplex.com/unity">Unity</a> (the one release from Microsoft that got to keep its cool name!) somewhat, though. Unity is Microsoft’s offering in the <acronym title="Inversion of Control">IoC</acronym>/<acronym title="Dependency Injection">DI</acronym> space. It has gotten some flak, but it really isn’t all that bad from what little I’ve used it. I do like that it is very lightweight and the fluent interface it provides for component registration is pretty good. The session itself was mainly demos, though, so not much content.</p> <p>I walked into a session by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/saraford/">Sara Ford</a> on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/">CodePlex</a>, but I didn’t stay too long because it seemed to be a walkthrough on how to use the CodePlex site itself.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Another session I attended that day was by <a href="http://blog.jimmy.schementi.com/">Jimmy Schementi</a> entitled “Dynamic Languages and the Web.” You can probably guess that this one was primarily on <a href="http://www.ironruby.net/">IronRuby</a>. As you might guess, a lot of the talk revolved around how dynamic languages will work with Silverlight. Jimmy pointed out the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/sdlsdk/">Silverlight Dynamic Languages SDK</a> which provides tooling for running dynamic languages under Silverlight, including IronRuby, IronPython, and other DLR based languages. It was pretty cool seeing a Rails app running on IronRuby. Jimmy also showed us an IronRuby version of <a href="http://tryruby.hobix.com/">Try Ruby</a>, which runs in the browser with Silverlight instead of having to ship the Ruby commands back to the server to be executed. (note – if you haven’t tried out Ruby, go use the Try Ruby site. It is an excellent introduction into an awesome language)</p> <p>I spent the rest of that day in Hands on Labs (see my <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/2008/06/18/HaveYouGuysEverLookedAtMicrosoftVirtualLabs.aspx">Virtual Labs post</a> to get an idea of the what the HOLs were like) and talking to the Microsoft guys. I spent time talking to a couple of developers on the .NET Framework team (whose names I unfortunately missed) and asked them a little bit about the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/clraddins/">MAF (Managed AddIn Framework)</a>. Their advice on that was to check with Jesse Kaplan (does Jesse have a blog I can link to?) so I did exactly that later in the week. I also spent time talking to them about versioning headaches and how we attempt to deal with breaking changes. It was interesting.</p> <p>Afterwards, they told me that the MSDN documentation guys were looking for feedback, so I swung by there. I didn’t get much information from them, but I tried to give them a lot of personal feedback on my feelings towards MSDN documentation. I currently still use Google to get to most of the MSDN help. I told them I used the local MSDN help up until Visual Studio 2005, at which point the help application because too slow to use. They seemed very welcome to hear feedback and I really think they’re trying to improve.</p> <p>All in all, it was a pretty good first day. That night was the vendor party where you basically sold yourself and your contact information for t-shirts and other swag. :-)</p>
