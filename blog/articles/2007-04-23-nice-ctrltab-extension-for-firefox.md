title: "Nice Ctrl+Tab extension for Firefox"

<p>I just wanted to share a Firefox extension I found recently. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1936">Stack Style Tabs</a> basically treats the Ctrl+Tab shortcut in Firefox like Alt+Tab in Windows or like Ctrl+Tab in Visual Studio. I use Visual Studio all day long and I really like the ability to SEE all of the open files when I hit Alt+Tab instead of just cycling through them. It has frustrated me for a while that Firefox didn't provide this capability as well, but with this new extension, I'm set!</p> <p>Here's a screenshot of it on my desktop:</p> <p><a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/NiceCtrlTabextensionforFirefox_B752/firefox-alt-tab%5B2%5D.png" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="557" src="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/NiceCtrlTabextensionforFirefox_B752/firefox-alt-tab_thumb.png" width="692" border="0"></a></p>
