title: "Nice Ctrl+Tab extension for Firefox"

I just wanted to share a Firefox extension I found recently. [Stack Style Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1936) basically treats the Ctrl+Tab shortcut in Firefox like Alt+Tab in Windows or like Ctrl+Tab in Visual Studio. I use Visual Studio all day long and I really like the ability to SEE all of the open files when I hit Alt+Tab instead of just cycling through them. It has frustrated me for a while that Firefox didn't provide this capability as well, but with this new extension, I'm set! 
Here's a screenshot of it on my desktop:
