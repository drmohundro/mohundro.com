title: "A Hard Copy of the Internet..."

According to [Gadgetopia](http://www.gadgetopia.com/post/5110), a 
nine-year old in North Dakota made a bet with his older brother that he could 
print the entire Internet.

You know, if the story stopped there, it might just be a cute story about 
childhood innocence or something like that. Unfortunately, it doesn't stop 
there. The bet is for $50 and he has 6 months to do it. It gets better. His 
hometown is HELPING him. They apparently have no idea just how big the Internet 
is.

As the post says,

Let's hope the environmentalists don't get their hands on this. This kid is 
going to need a few rainforests to get all the paper he'll need. On top of that, 
there is a whole lot of stuff on the Internet that is completely inappropriate 
for a nine-year old (much less a 25-year old like myself).

Maybe if his brother is nice, he can get a deadline.
