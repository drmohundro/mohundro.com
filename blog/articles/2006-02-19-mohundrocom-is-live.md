When I registered [www.mohundro.com](http://www.mohundro.com), it was always my intention to have a technical blog (what you're reading) and a personal site where my wife and I could post pictures and news. I wanted the primary site to be for family, etc, so I made that the root directory. My technical blog (which likely will get more visitors) would live in a subfolder.

Well, I've finally put a site out there for my wife and I and it is at [http://www.mohundro.com](http://www.mohundro.com). Easy enough to remember if you can get to this page. I've also added a link under my navigation to get there. I plan on blogging about some of the techniques I used with it soon so, if you're interested, check back soon.
