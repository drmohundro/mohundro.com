I was looking through [programming.reddit.com](http://programming.reddit.com/) today and [discovered that IronLisp](http://xacc.wordpress.com/2007/08/21/ironlisp-is-now-open/) now has a website on Codeplex. I haven't coded in LISP since college, but it was certainly an interesting experience. 

This got me thinking - how many Iron* projects are there now? This is what I've come up with: 

- 1) [IronPython](http://codeplex.com/IronPython) - the original Iron project? 
- 2) [IronRuby](http://www.iunknown.com/2007/07/a-first-look-at.html) 
- 3) [IronLisp](http://www.codeplex.com/IronLisp) 
- 4) [IronXSLT]() - (thanks Michael!)
- 5) ...

Hmmm... as I was thinking about this blog post, I seemed to think there were a lot more out there. I know there are a lot of other languages that support the CLR, but I guess the Iron designation seems to be fitting with the languages that are build on top of the DLR. I'm a little curious if the [Smalltalk/DLR implementation](http://vistascript.net/vistascript/docuwiki/doku.php) (Vista Smalltalk) will make the name change to IronSmalltalk or not. 

So where did the Iron naming scheme come from anyway? Why not Nython<sup>1</sup> or NRuby<sup>2</sup>? :-) 

<sup>1</sup> - The Java implementation is Jython.<br />
<sup>2</sup> - The Java implementation is JRuby.
