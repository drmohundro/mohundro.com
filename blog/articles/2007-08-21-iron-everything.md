<p>I was looking through <a href="http://programming.reddit.com/">programming.reddit.com</a> today and <a href="http://xacc.wordpress.com/2007/08/21/ironlisp-is-now-open/">discovered that IronLisp</a> now has a website on Codeplex. I haven't coded in LISP since college, but it was certainly an interesting experience.</p> <p>This got me thinking - how many Iron* projects are there now? This is what I've come up with:</p> <p>1) <a href="http://codeplex.com/IronPython">IronPython</a> - the original Iron project?</p> <p>2) <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2007/07/a-first-look-at.html">IronRuby</a></p> <p>3) <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronLisp">IronLisp</a></p> <p>4) <a href="">IronXSLT</a> - (thanks Michael!)<br></p><p>5) ...<br></p> <p>Hmmm... as I was thinking about this blog post, I seemed to think there were a lot more out there. I know there are a lot of other languages that support the CLR, but I guess the Iron designation seems to be fitting with the languages that are build on top of the DLR. I'm a little curious if the <a href="http://vistascript.net/vistascript/docuwiki/doku.php">Smalltalk/DLR implementation</a> (Vista Smalltalk) will make the name change to IronSmalltalk or not.</p> <p>So where did the Iron naming scheme come from anyway? Why not Nython<sup>1</sup> or NRuby<sup>2</sup>? :-)</p> <p><sup>1</sup> - The Java implementation is Jython.</p> <p><sup>2</sup> - The Java implementation is JRuby.</p>
