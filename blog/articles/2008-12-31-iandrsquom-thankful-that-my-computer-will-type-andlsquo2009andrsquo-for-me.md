<p>So, a year ago to the day, I posted <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/2008/01/01/Welcome20082007InReview.aspx">my review of 2007 with a look towards 2008</a>. To continue that age old tradition, I will now review 2008.</p> <p><strong>Learning</strong></p> <p>I started off the month by stating that <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/2008/01/30/LearningTechnologiesOutsideAndInsideOfTheMicrosoftEcosystem.aspx">I wanted to learn some new languages, primarily Python and Ruby</a>. I’m sad to say that I haven’t made it past the 5th python challenge yet. I pretty much got distracted, which is a lame excuse. On the other hand, instead of learning languages, I’ve learned a ton about editing in VIM and even a little about Emacs (though I have to use viper or vimpulse to be at all productive in Emacs). I’m even using ViEmu in Visual Studio. The Vim key-bindings have become muscle memory now and I consider that a positive thing. I’m still going to try to learn other languages this year, but I’m going to need a project to work on before I can become proficient.</p> <p><strong>FSDNUG</strong></p> <p>This year, a very exciting thing for me was the formation of <a href="http://www.fsdnug.org">FSDNUG</a>. <a href="http://www.mpaladino.com/">Michael Paladino</a> pretty much did all of the work, but he lets me call myself a co-leader. <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/2008/03/04/FSDNUGMeetingWithRaymondLewallenOnBehaviorDrivenDesign.aspx">Raymond Lewallen opened up the FSDNUG meetings by speaking about Behavior Driven Development</a>. I didn’t really grok BDD at that point, but I’m learning. I most definitely prefer the context/specification style of naming specs over traditional TDD test names.</p> <p><strong>Conferences</strong></p> <p>I was fortunate enough to attend both <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/2008/07/02/TechEdNdashDay1Review.aspx">Tech Ed</a> and <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/2008/08/27/devLink2008Recap.aspx">DevLink</a> this year. I even told people at DevLink that I’d be attending <a href="http://codemash.org/">CodeMash</a>, but I sadly won’t be able to make it after all. I have no doubts that it will be an amazing conference, though, and wish I could be there.</p> <p><strong>Presentations</strong></p> <p>I presented on PowerShell three times in 2008. <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/2008/09/09/PowerShellFSDNUGPresentationWithSlidesAndNotes.aspx">Once to FSDNUG</a>, <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/2008/09/30/SlidesAndNotesFromMNUGTalk.aspx">once to MNUG</a> and then once to Harding University CS students. My presentations pretty much took up <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/default,month,2008-09.aspx">all of September</a>. It was a great experience and I’m looking forward to speaking to the Shreveport .NET User Group in March!</p> <p><strong>Posts</strong></p> <p>My post on <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/2008/05/23/RealWorldWalkthroughWithWinDbg.aspx">“real world debugging witn WinDbg” post</a> was featured on the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/events/teched/cc531163.aspx">Tech Ed bloggers site</a>, which led to me being selected as a “featured Tech Ed blogger” for a day. I was also excited to have my <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/2008/10/11/SimplePowerShellScriptToGenerateThumbnails.aspx">PowerShell thumbnail script</a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Powerscripting/~3/455545211/index.php">mentioned on the PowerScripting Podcast</a>.</p> <p><strong>In closing…</strong></p> <p>All in all, a really great year. I noted in 2007, that it had been the year of the most growth for me as a developer. That was true… at least until 2008. My opinion right now is that there is no such thing as a good developer, only a better developer. This saying comes from a discussion I had with a coworker a few months back where we came to the conclusion that there isn’t such a thing as a good design or architecture, only a better design or architecture – all because we’ll inevitably have learned a better way to do things in the future.</p> <p>I hope everyone has a great 2009!</p>
