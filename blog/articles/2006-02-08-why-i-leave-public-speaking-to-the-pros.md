[Rory Blyth](http://neopoleon.com/blog/), the man who brought us the "steel cage death match" of the [Avalon authors](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/17092.aspx), tells us what happens [when public speaking goes wrong](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/17449.aspx).

(My driving comments were an allusion to his post... I do drive my car each and every day to work... in case you were wondering...)
