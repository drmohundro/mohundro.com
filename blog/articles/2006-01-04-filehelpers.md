By way of [Larkware](http://www.larkware.com/dg4/TheDailyGrind791.html), I came across the [FileHelpers](http://filehelpers.sourceforge.net/) library written by Marcos Meli. It looks like a great solution for dealing with delimited or fixed length file formats. The majority of the output formats from our backend systems at work are fixed length file formats, which can be a pain to parse. I had actually written a library to parse them and reference portions of each line by name (sort of a named index to portions of a line), but this looks like a much cleaner approach. I'll dig into this some more and post my thoughts on it.
