I guess this is really more of a _link_ regarding ASP.NET AJAX and Full Trust. 

Ken Cox [points out](http://weblogs.asp.net/kencox/archive/2006/10/21/Full-Trust-Strikes-Again.aspx) that the new AJAX extensions install themselves into the GAC instead of a Bin subdirectory. I hadn't really thought about this until he notes how this affects those of us (me included) who have shared web hosting.

I've been putting a picture slideshow together for my sister's wedding and I've spent the past couple of nights working on a nice, AJAX-y website that would allow her to pick her own captions for the pictures and customize the slides without me having to email a huge PowerPoint file to her. It sounds like I'll have to look at another option for the time being, though, because I doubt I'll be able to convince my web host to install beta software to the GAC. 

_\*sigh\*_

What fun it is being a beta junkie.
