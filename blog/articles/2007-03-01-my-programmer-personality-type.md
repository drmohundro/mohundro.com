<blockquote> <p>Your programmer personality type is:<br><b>DHSC</b>  <p><b>You're a Doer.</b><br>You are very quick at getting tasks done. You believe the outcome is the most important part of a task and the faster you can reach that outcome the better. After all, time is money.<br><b>You like coding at a High level.</b><br>The world is made up of objects and components, you should create your programs in the same way.<br><b>You work best in a Solo situation.</b><br>The best way to program is by yourself. There's no communication problems, you know every part of the code allowing you to write the best programs possible.<br><b>You are a Conservative programmer.</b><br>The less code you write, the less chance there is of it containing a bug. You write short and to the point code that gets the job done efficiently.</p></blockquote> <p>Find out your score at <a title="http://www.doolwind.com/index.php?page=11" href="http://www.doolwind.com/index.php?page=11">http://www.doolwind.com/index.php?page=11</a>.</p>
