title: "Standard Feed Icons"

As some of you may have noticed, I changed my blog's theme ever so slightly to encorporate the cool, orange feed icon:<br><br>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/images/feed-icon-32x32.gif"><br><br>It is quickly becoming the standard way to indicate to users that a feed is available for aggregation. By way of <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">FeedBurner</a>, I found the <a href="http://feedicons.com/">Feed Icons</a> website, which is striving to help establish the icon as a standard. There, you can download the icon in different colors so it better fits your existing theme. If you've got a site that has a feed, you might consider updating your site to use the new icons. I believe that <a href="http://www.firefox.com">FireFox</a> was the first to use the icon, but now <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rssteam/archive/2005/12/14/503778.aspx">Internet Explorer has decided to use the icon</a> as well. Standardization is a great thing, eh?<br><p></p>
