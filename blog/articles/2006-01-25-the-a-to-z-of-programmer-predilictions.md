<P>"The A to Z of Programmer Predilictions" is a funny little article that categorizes programmers into various stereotypes, most of which are surprisingly accurate. As I read through the descriptions, I started spotting people in my organization. Though I (and everyone else)&nbsp;can probably fit into a variety of different personas described there, I probably am most like "Zealous Zack." I DO download all of the betas (even at work!) and, when someone blogs about the "Next New Thing," I've got the download started before I've finished reading the post about it.</P>
<P>Speaking of, I need to download the newest WinFX bits...</P>
