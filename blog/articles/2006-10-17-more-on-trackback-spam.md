title: "More on Trackback Spam..."

<p>Earlier this week, I <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,10eb4b00-b733-47c4-996d-662d88663681.aspx">posted</a> on some major problems I was having with trackback spam. By way of a comment, Tim Rayburn pointed me to his <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/ct.ashx?id=10eb4b00-b733-47c4-996d-662d88663681&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.timrayburn.net%2f2006%2f10%2f17%2fUpgrading%2bTo%2bDasBlog%2b196288.aspx">post</a> on Akismet support that the nightly builds of dasBlog now included.</p> <p>As a result, last night, I downloaded the latest build of dasBlog and uploaded the new binaries to my blog. Shortly thereafter, I was able to log onto my blog and see the section for Akismet. Sweet! I went ahead and signed up for a Wordpress account (by doing so, you can get a free Akismet API code). Things were looking great so I thought I'd let it go and check it the next day.</p> <p>Today is the next day and I just finished deleting about 250 spam trackbacks on various posts. Needless to say, I've disabled Trackback support on my blog again.</p> <p>My problem is that I'm not sure if I messed up on my upgrade or if there is a problem with the Akismet support... OR maybe it is because of the possibility that my web host doesn't allow web requests (see <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2006/10/17/Why_Oh_Why_Couldnt_WebPermission_Be_Part_Of_Medium_Trust.aspx">Phil's post</a>&nbsp;on WebPermission and Akismet in SubText). I'm not in control of the web server my blog runs on, so I wouldn't be at all surprised to find that my blog doesn't have WebPermission. I guess my problem is that I'm not really sure if that's the problem or if it is something else entirely. I'm blogging this from work over my lunch break, so I don't have time to dig through logs right now.</p> <p>I guess I'm just blogging because I'm a little down because Trackback spam won today.</p> <p>Spam is stupid.</p>
