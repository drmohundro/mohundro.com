<p>If you seriously still haven’t heard or used PowerShell yet, come to my Little Rock DNUG presentation on the topic on Monday, July 13. Or, if you’re busy Monday night because you’re going to hear <a href="http://keithelder.net/blog/">Keith Elder</a> speak on Velocity to the <a href="http://fsdnug.org/">Fort Smith DNUG</a>, then come Tuesday night to hear me give my PowerShell presentation to the Conway DNUG instead!</p> <p>I’ve never given a talk two days in a row, so this will be a new experience for me. If you’re interested in the content, I’m trying to keep my presentation notes and related files up on <a href="http://github.com/drmohundro/presentations/tree/master">one of my github projects</a>. I’m finding that the whole distributed source control works well for me for accessing and working on my presentation from all different areas and computers.</p> <p>If you’re at the meeting, stop by and say hi!</p>
